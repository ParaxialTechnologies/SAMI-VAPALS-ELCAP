1. Description
 
 SAMI*18.0*10 SEQ #10 fixes the following bugs in the CT Eval report.
 This patch includes 9 bug fixes and enhancements:
 
 1.1. VAP-464: Coronary artery calcification report issues
 
      problem: Presume a patient has no coronary artery calcifications
      (CAC). If you leave all the fields blank in the section CAC
      section (which perhaps should not be possible on the form), the
      report text looks like: "Coronary Artery Calcifications: in left
      main, in left anterior descending, in circumflex, and in right
      coronary. The Visual Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score is 0."
      
      Again, presume a patient has no CAC. If you put none for all the
      individual arteries, the text is blank: "Coronary Artery
      Calcifications: Cardiac Findings:". It should list none for all
      of the individual arteries and say the score is 0.
 
      solution: CT Report fixed
 
 1.2. VAP-468: Individual CAC score not required, even though labeled
      as required
 
      problem: Individual CAC scores have red asterisk but form does
      not require them. In turn, this causes the CT report to print
      out incorrectly. Should be required for IELCAP.
 
      solution: CT Report fixed
 
 1.3. Typos in CT report
 
      problem: Sentences should have a space after period.
 
      solution: CT Report fixed
 
 1.4. Cardiac findings in CT report
 
      problem: Cardiac findings section header is always printed, even
      if there are no cardiac findings
 
      solution: CT Report fixed
 
 1.5. CT report should include average diameter
 
      problem: Nodule size should list avg diameter in addition to
      length and width.
 
      solution: CT Report fixed
 
 1.6. CT report header has weird date and age-1
 
      problem: HL7 date format was not being recognized, so the header
      had a weird date and age -1.
 
      solution: CT Report header fixed at the top of the report page,
      and the header everywhere it appears throughout VAPALS-ELCAP.
 
 1.7. Enrollment report needs to be able to be sorted alphabetically
 
      problem: Need to be able to be sorted by name and (ideally) also
      by date.
 
      solution: Reports list fixed
 
 1.8. Provide total number of records in User Reports
 
      problem: enhancement desired
 
      solution: fixed
 
 1.9. Pre-enrollment existing
 
      problem: logic bug in detecting pre-enrollment existing
 
      solution: fixed

3. Package-retrieval instructions
 
 The software for this patch is being released as KIDS package
 sami-1.18.0.10-i10.zip via git or via direct file transfer. These
 instructions are for your Vista environment's sysadmin. As usual,
 please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it to
 your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.
 
 
 3.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user
 
   This step assumes you type a sudo command to do this. If your
   configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
   configuration:
 
    $ sudo su - osehra
 
 
 3.2. Prepare the archive file
   
   Create install and backup directories
 
    $ mkdir -p ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.10/back/www/
 
 
   If using git to receive packages, update your VAPALS-ELCAP git
   repo, copy the VAPALS-ELCAP 1.18.0.10-i10 archive file to your
   install directory, and change directories to that install
   directory:
 
    $ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/
    $ git pull
    [...a successful git pull will result in some chatter...]
    $ cp dist/1.18.0.10/sami-1.18.0.10-i10.zip \
      ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.10/
 
   If NOT using git, download the archive from the patch webpage:
    
    http://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/sami-1.18.0.10-i10.html
    
    As the identity of the sysadmin Unix user, follow your usual
    procedure to transfer archive file sami-1.18.0.10-i10.zip to one of
    the sysadmin user directories and change to that directory.
    
    Then move the archive file to the osehra user install directory,
    change ownership of the archive file to osehra, assume the osehra
    user identity, and change directories to that install directory:
 
    $ sudo mv sami-1.18.0.10-i10.zip \
      /home/osehra/run/in/sami/1.18.0.10/
    $ sudo chown osehra:osehra \
      /home/osehra/run/in/sami/1.18.0.10/sami-1.18.0.10-i10.zip
    $ sudo su - osehra
 
 
 3.3. Expand the KIDS archive
   
   Change directories to the install directory, and expand the archive
   file, using the unix unzip command:
    
    $ cd ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.10/
    $ unzip sami-1.18.0.10-i10.zip
    Archive:  sami-1.18.0.10-i10.zip
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.10-i10-recipe.txt
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.10-i10.kid
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.10-i10.txt
    $ cd
    $ 
 
 
 
4. Pre-install instructions
 
 It is important when installing packages to back up the existing
 package elements that are about to be changed, so that if anything
 goes wrong with the install, these package elements can be restored.
 For this patch, we will back up M routines.
 
 
 4.1. Enter M
    
    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the csession command on Cache or the mumps command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:
 
    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals
    
    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS
    
    >
 
 
    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir
    
    >
 
 
 4.2. Sign into Vista
    
    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:
 
    > do ^XUP
    
    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.
    
    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100
    
    You have 47 new messages.
    Select OPTION NAME:
    >
 
 
 4.3. Back up routines
    
    Back up existing VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten
    by this install. Do this by calling direct-mode interface ^%RO
    (routine out), selecting the list of routines to save, selecting
    sami-1.18.0.10-i10-back.ro to save to, and answering any other
    additional prompts.
    
    The prompts vary between M implementations, so be sure to follow
    the correct dialog for your imp. The routine names to save are
    listed below under each imp; copy the list and paste it at the
    Routine prompt. At the final Routine prompt, press return to
    indicate the list of routines is done.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
