3. Package-retrieval instructions
 
 The software for this test patch is being released as KIDS package
 sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.zip via git or via direct file transfer. These
 instructions are for your Vista environment's sysadmin. As usual,
 please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it to
 your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.
 
 
 3.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user
 
   This step assumes you type a sudo command to do this. If your
   configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
   configuration:
 
    $ sudo su - osehra
 
 
 3.2. Prepare the archive file
   
   Create install and backup directories
 
    $ mkdir -p ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11-t1/back/www/
 
 
   If using git to receive packages, update your VAPALS-ELCAP git
   repo, copy the VAPALS-ELCAP 1.18.0.11-i11-t1 archive file to your
   install directory, and change directories to that install
   directory:
 
    $ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/
    $ git pull
    [...a successful git pull will result in a great deal of chatter...]
    $ cp dist/1.18.0.11/sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.zip \
      ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11-t1/
    
    This git method of receiving packages also completes half of the
    package install, because it updates the web files, leaving only
    the KIDS package to be installed to complete the installation. If
    you are not prepared to proceed with the install, we recommend
    either waiting to retrieve the package via git until you are ready
    to proceed, or using the non-git method in advance and waiting to
    perform the git pull until the end of the pre-install steps.
 
 
   If NOT using git, download the archive from the patch webpage:
    
    http://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/sami-1.18.0.11-i11.html
    
    As the identity of the sysadmin Unix user, follow your usual
    procedure to transfer archive file sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.zip to
    one of the sysadmin user directories and change to that directory.
    
    Then move the archive file to the osehra user install directory,
    change ownership of the archive file to osehra, assume the osehra
    user identity, and change directories to that install directory:
 
    $ sudo mv sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.zip \
      /home/osehra/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11-t1/
    $ sudo chown osehra:osehra \
      /home/osehra/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11-t1/sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.zip
    $ sudo su - osehra
 
 
 3.3. Expand the KIDS archive
   
   Change directories to the install directory, and expand the archive
   file, using the unix unzip command:
    
    $ cd ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11-t1/
    $ unzip sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.zip
    Archive:  sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.zip
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1-recipe.txt
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.kid
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1.txt
      inflating: www/... [9 MB of www files]
    $ cd
    $ 
 
 
 
4. Pre-install instructions
 
 It is important when installing packages to back up the existing
 package elements that are about to be changed, so that if anything
 goes wrong with the install, these package elements can be restored.
 For this patch, it's M routines and www files we will back up.
 
 
 4.1. Enter M
    
    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the csession command on Cache or the mumps command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:
 
    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals
    
    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS
    
    >
 
 
    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir
    
    >
 
 
 4.2. Sign into Vista
    
    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:
 
    > do ^XUP
    
    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.
    
    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100
    
    You have 47 new messages.
    Select OPTION NAME:
    >
 
 
 4.3. Back up routines
    
    Back up existing VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten
    by this install. Do this by calling direct-mode interface ^%RO
    (routine out), selecting the list of routines to save, selecting
    sami-1.18.0.11-i11-t1-back.ro to save to, and answering any other
    additional prompts.
    
    The prompts vary between M implementations, so be sure to follow
    the correct dialog for your imp. The routine names to save are
    listed below under each imp; copy the list and paste it at the
    Routine prompt. At the final Routine prompt, press return to
    indicate the list of routines is done.
 
 
    4.3.1. List of routines
SAMICSV
SAMINOT1
SAMINUL
SAMIUR
 
 
    4.3.2. On Cache
    
    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
    respectively:
    
    > do ^%RO
    
    Routine output (please use %ROMF for object code output)
    Routine(s): SAMICSV
    Routine(s): SAMINOT1

    Printer Format? No => No

    4.3.3. On YottaDB/GT.M
    
    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Header Label and press return at the Strip comments
    prompt to accept the default of No:
    
    > do ^%RO

 4.4. Back up www files
    
    Back up existing www files that will be overwritten by this
    install. Do this by exiting M and copying the www directory to the
    install backup directory:
    
    > halt
    $ cp -r ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/* \
      ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11-t1/back/www/
    $

 5.5. Install the www files
 
   If you use the git repo method of VAPALS-ELCAP package distribution
   and during this install you have already run the git pull command
   to update your sami repo clone, then the www files were installed
   when you did that.
   
   If you use the git repo method but have not yet run git pull, then
   run the cd and git pull commands:
   
    $ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/
    $ git pull
   
   If you DO NOT use the git repo distribution method, then instead
   run this cp command:
 
    $ cp -r ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11-t1/www/* \
      ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/
 
 
 
 5.6. Activate the www files and exit M
 
 
   5.6.1. Enter M
   
    Repeat step 4.1 to enter M.
   
   
   5.6.2. Sign into Vista
 
    Repeat step 4.2 to sign into Vista.
 
 
   5.6.3. Rebuild M-Web's cached www files
   
    To improve performance, M-Web maintains cached copies of the html
    templates used by its services, so every time we update those
    html files in Unix, we must also direct M-Web to update its cached
    copies.
 
    > do CLRWEB^SAMIADMN
    
    >
 
 
   5.6.4. Exit M
 
    > halt
    $
 
 
 
 You now have VAPALS-ELCAP 1.18.0.11-i11-t1 (SAMI*18.0*11 SEQ #11 T1)
 installed in your M environment. The install is now complete. We
 recommend running tests of your VAPALS-ELCAP app to confirm the
 environment is operational and bug-free, before notifying users that
 VAPALS-ELCAP is ready for their use.
 
 
 
6. Optional backout instructions
 
 Should errors or other problems result from installing this package
 contact the VAPALS development team for package-backout instructions.
 
 
 
7. Routines
 
 Lines 2 & 3 of each of these routines now look like:
