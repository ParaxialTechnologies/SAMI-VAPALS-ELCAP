1. Description
 
 SAMI*18.0*11 SEQ #11 fixes a number of critical and high-priority
 bugs.
 
 This file captures the text from the full patch webpage, which can be
 read here:
    
 http://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/sami-1.18.0.11-i11.html
 
 The definitive source for the VAPALS-ELCAP application - codebase,
 package distributions (including this patch), and documentation - is
 at the following public Github repository:
 
 https://github.com/VA-PALS-ELCAP/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/
 
 These instructions are for your Vista environment’s sysadmin. As
 usual, please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it
 to your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.
 
 There are 30 bug fixes related to the following functionality:
 
 HL7 (2)
 Intake (4)
 Export (1)
 CT (12)
 Intervention (2)
 PET and Biopsy (4)
 Reports (5)
 
 
 1.1. HL7: Make HL7 patient name match case insensitive
 
      problem: If manual registration has entered mixed-case names,
      HL7 bringing over uppercase names was failing to match them,
      resulting in the creation of duplicate patient records.
 
      solution: VAPALS-ELCAP HL7 interface was changed to a case-
      insensitive matching process. Names are temporarily converted to
      uppercase to ensure matches are found, to avoid creating
      duplicates when HL7 brings over a patient who ought to match an
      existing patient.
 
 1.2. HL7: Make HL7 match include patient name Suffix
 
      problem: HL7 was registering patients without the Suffix field,
      which caused later HL7 messages involving those patients to fail
      to match, because the incoming HL7 message included Suffix but
      the patient's entry in the VAPALS-ELCAP graphstore did not.
 
      solution: VAPALS-ELCAP HL7 interface now handles Suffix.
 
 1.3. Intake: some Clinical Indications text not transmitted by HL7
 
      problem: On Intake Form, in the Clinical Indications text box,
      HL7 does not transmit some text after a line break.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.4. Intake: VAP-483: need N/A option for Shared Decision Making
 
      problem: On Intake Form, Shared Decision Making (SDM) should
      either be Done or N/A. If N/A, the Intake Note should say
      "Shared decision making is not applicable"; convert to radio
      buttons.
 
      solution: The checkboxes were converted to radio buttons, and
      the functionality fixed.
 
 1.5. Intake: VAP-482: update Shared Decision Making text
 
      problem: New wording desired: include "...In addition, the
      Veteran has been educated today about the imporance of adhering
      to annual lung screening, the possible..."
 
      solution: updated.
 
 1.6. Intake: export has extra line breaks
 
      problem: One of the Comment fields causes extra line breaks in
      the export.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.7. Data export: needs to correctly handle quotes in text
 
      problem: If a text field has a quote in it, this quote is passed
      through to the output unescaped. This in turn causes problems
      for other programs that import the file, e.g. Excel. The CSV
      spec requests for embedded quotes to be double quoted.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.8. CT: Prior Scans field should not be compulsory
 
      problem: Prior Scans field should be pre-filled with prior dates
      but also be editable to enter scans not in system. Prior Scans,
      Most Recent, and Comparison Scan need to be editable even for
      baseline. If no baseline CT form, then Baseline CT, Most Recent
      Comparative Study, and Prior Scans fields should be empty. In
      some cases, the baseline CT scan will not be the first CT scan.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.9. CT: VAP-480: Add 1.25 mm slice thickness as option
 
      problem: In Reconstructed Thickness drop-down field, 1.25 mm
      needs to be an option for slice thickness.
 
      solution: added.
 
 1.10. CT: VAP-481: Low-dose protocol should be default
 
      problem: In CT Protocol field, set default to Low-dose.
 
      solution: done.
 
 1.11. CT: VAP-489: Only require single image number
 
      problem: In Image Number field, only require the lower image
      number rather than both lower and upper. Most radiologists only
      provide a single image number.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.12. CT: VAP-478: Don't display single CAC score if I-ELCAP protocol
 
      problem: Remove Coronary Artery Calcification radio options for
      ELCAP users.
 
      solution: removed.
 
 1.13. CT: VAP-479: Enter Additional... Nodules checkboxes if no nodule 1
 
      problem: Need to be able to enter additional small nodules if
      participant doesn't have a nodule 1. Unable to enter Additional
      Calcified Nodules or Additional Non-calcified Nodules without
      first entering a nodule. We need a way to enter those two items
      without a nodule (for example, if a veteran has a lot of very
      small nodules but none are big enough to note on the grid).
 
      solution: Moved the Additional... Nodules checkboxes outside the
      nodule grid. Removed the word Additional.
 
 1.14. CT: VAP-491: Clear some fields when copy-forward to new form
 
      problem: When copying the nodule grid forward from a previous
      form to a new form, if a nodule status is set to Prev Seen,
      Resolved or Prev Seen, Resected or Not a Nodule, the nodule grid
      should only keep the Is It New, Nodule Status, and Likely
      Location fields. The rest should be cleared in the new form.
 
      At present copy-forward requires all the additional nodule info.
      If previous report had a nodule, then when copying forward to
      the new form, if you select Prev Seen, Resolved, we want to zero
      out most of the values and just keep the nodule status and most
      likely location, interactively while working on the nodule grid.
      This change must be made to the HTML grid & to the copy-forward.
      This rule should only apply from one CT Evaluation to another CT
      Evaluation.
 
      solution: implemented.
 
 1.15. CT Report: Bad text if C/NC Nodules checked
 
      problem: When CT Evaluation Form field Calcified/Non-calcified
      Nodules if checked, the CT Report incorrectly says
      "no ... nodule". It should say "small calcified/non-calcified
      nodules are present."
 
      solution: fixed.																			
 
 1.16. CT: VAP-484: Override Annual Repeat date
 
      problem: When Low-dose CT Follow-up is set to Annual Repeat,
      typing a date into its Date field resets Low-dose CT Follow-up
      to Other.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.17. CT: Non-CT follow-up now
 
      problem: In cases where non-CT interventions are recommended
      (such as PET, biopsy, etc.), the Follow-up Date should be now.
      It should be able to be the only recommendation in the
      impression.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.18. CT: VAP-488: Ascending Aorta Width should allow decimals
 
      problem: Under Cardiac and Aorta, Ascending Aorta Width field is
      forced to be whole number. It should allow decimals. (The
      Pulmonary Artery Width field should also allow decimals, but it
      already works correctly.)
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.19. CT & Intervention: VAP-490: Move 3 fields from Cardiac & Aorta
 
      problem: On the CT and Intervention forms, three fields -
      Pulmonary Artery Width, Ascending Artery Width, and a third
      field - should be moved from Cardiac and Aorta to Emphysema/
      Coronary Calcifications.
 
      solution: moved.
 
 1.20. Intervention: Form date incorrect
 
      problem: The intervention date on the Case Review Page uses the
      date the form was created, but it should use the date of the
      intervention, or if not filled out, the date of the first
      intervention.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.21. Intervention: Nodule grid copy-forward
 
      problem: Intervention form copy-forward isn't working.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.22. PET & Biopsy: Form dates incorrect
 
      problem: The PET and Biopsy dates on the Case Review Page use
      the date the form was created, but it should use the date of the
      PET scan or biopsy, respectively, or if not filled out, the date
      of the first PET scan or biopsy.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.23. PET & Biopsy: Auto-fill dates for new forms
 
      problem: The Baseline CT Date and Most Recent CT Date fields are
      not automatically filled in when creating a new PET or Biopsy																					
      Form.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.24. PET & Biopsy: Nodule grid copy-forward
 
      problem: PET and Biopsy form copy-forward aren't working.
 
      solution: fixed.
 
 1.25. PET & Biopsy: Follow-up should not be required
 
      problem: On the PET and Biopsy forms, follow-up is required, but
      it should not be.
 
      solution: made optional.
 
 1.26. Case Review: Reorder new-form list
 
      problem: On the Case Review Page, in the New Form drop-down
      field list, move PET Evaluation ahead of Biopsy, and move
      Follow-up ahead of CT Eval.
 
      solution: reordered.
 
 1.27. Enrollment Report: Case-insensitive alphabetical order
 
      problem: In the Enrollment Report, patient names are out of
      order in a case-sensitive way. Uppercase letters come before
      lowercase letters, e.g. GZ comes before Ga.
 
      solution: Re-sorted to be case-insensitive.
 
 1.28. Enrollment Report: Empty Gender and race
 
      problem: On the Enrollment Report, the Gender and Race fields
      are empty. At least Gender should be filled in; we may not have
      a source for Race.
 
      solution: Gender now consistently filled in for Enrollment
      Report. Race reserved until we have a data source.
 
 1.29. Inactive Report
 
      problem: VAPALS-ELCAP users would like a report that shows which
      patients are inactive or have withdrawn from the program.
 
      solution: created.
 
 1.30. Reports: Move Last Exam field ahead of Recommended Follow-up
 
      problem: The Last Exam field seems to be redundant if it follows
      the Recommended Follow-up. Last Exam should be moved ahead 
      it.
 
      solution: columns re-ordered.

3. Backup instructions
 
 It is important when installing packages to back up the existing
 package elements that are about to be changed, so that if anything
 goes wrong with the install, these package elements can be restored.
 For this patch, it's M routines and www files we will back up.
 
 
 3.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user
 
   This step assumes you type a sudo command to do this. If your
   configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
   configuration:
 
    $ sudo su - osehra
 
 
 3.2. Prepare install directory
   
   Create install and backup directories
 
    $ mkdir -p ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11/back/www/
 
 
 3.3. Back up www files
    
    Back up existing www files that will be overwritten by this
    install. Do this by exiting M and copying the www directory to the
    install backup directory:
    
    $ cp -r ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/* \
      ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11/back/www/
    $ 
 
 
 3.4. Enter M
    
    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the csession command on Cache or the mumps command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:
 
    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals
    
    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS
    
    >
 
 
    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir
    
    >
 
 
 3.5. Sign into Vista
    
    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:
 
    > do ^XUP
    
    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.
    
    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100
    
    You have 47 new messages.
    Select OPTION NAME:
    >
 
 
 3.6. Back up routines
    
    Back up existing VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten
    by this install. Do this by calling direct-mode interface ^%RO
    (routine out), selecting the list of routines to save, selecting
    sami-1.18.0.11-back.ro to save to, and answering any other
    additional prompts.
    
    The prompts vary between M implementations, so be sure to follow
    the correct dialog for your imp. The routine names to save are
    listed below under each imp; copy the list and paste it at the
    Routine prompt. At the final Routine prompt, press return to
    indicate the list of routines is done.

4. Package-retrieval instructions
 
 Your VAPALS-ELCAP environment is now ready to install VAPALS-ELCAP
 1.18.0.11+i11 (SAMI*18.0*11 SEQ #11), so next retrieve the package.
 
 
 4.1. Download and prepare the archive file
   
   You may safely download the archive file from the patch webpage in
   advance of the actual install. To do this, download it from here:
   
   http://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/sami-1-18-0-11+i11.zip
   
   Once the file is on the VAPALS-ELCAP instance server, use sudo to
   move the archive file from whatever directory it's in (here
   referred to as $WHATEVERDIR, which should be replaced with the
   actual directory where the archive file is stored) to the osehra
   user install directory, change the ownership of the file to osehra,
   and then assume the osehra user identity and change directories to
   that install directory:
 
   $ sudo mv $WHATEVERDIR/sami-1.18.0.11-i11.zip \
     /home/osehra/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11/
   $ sudo chown osehra:osehra \
     /home/osehra/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11/sami-1.18.0.11-i11.zip
   $ sudo su - osehra
   $ cd ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11/
 
 
 4.2. Expand the archive
   
   Change directories to the install directory, and expand the archive
   file, using the unix unzip command:

 5.5. Install the www files
 
 At this point in the install process, the VAPALS-ELCAP routines have
 been updated, but the corresponding www files have not, so they are
 out of sync with each other. Steps 5.5 and 5.6 update the www files
 to bring them into sync.
 
 VA VAPALS-ELCAP sysadmins should follow step 5.5.1. Non-VA sysadmins
 should follow step 5.5.2.
 
 
   5.5.1. For VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems
   
   The VA firewall blocks access to the official VAPALS-ELCAP Github
   repository, so VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems do not maintain repo clones.
   Instead, they manually copy the www files into place by running
   these commands:
 
    $ rm -rf ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/*
    $ cp -r ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.11/www/* \
      ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/
   
   
   5.5.2. For Non-VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems
   
   Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date
   clones of the official Github repository. Performing a git pull
   from that repo will automatically update the system's live www
   files, which are accessed via a symlink to the clone's files. Run
   these commands:
   
    $ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/
    $ git pull
 
 
 
 5.6. Activate the www files and exit M
 
 At this point in the install process, the VAPALS-ELCAP routines and
 www files have both been updated, but the routines are using cached
 copies of the www files. Step 5.6 refreshes that cache to activate
 the www files.
 
 
   5.6.1. Enter M
   
    Repeat step 3.4 to enter M.
   
   
   5.6.2. Sign into Vista
 
    Repeat step 3.5 to sign into Vista.
 
 
   5.6.3. Rebuild M-Web's cached www files
   
    To improve performance, M-Web maintains cached copies of the html
    templates used by its services, so every time we update those
    html files in Unix, we must also direct M-Web to update its cached
    copies.
 
    > do CLRWEB^SAMIADMN
    
    >
 
 
   5.6.4. Exit M
 
    > halt
    $
 
 
 You now have VAPALS-ELCAP 1.18.0.11+i11 (SAMI*18.0*11 SEQ #11)
 installed in your M environment. The install is now complete. We
 recommend running tests of your VAPALS-ELCAP app to confirm the
 environment is operational and bug-free, before notifying users that
 VAPALS-ELCAP is ready for their use.
