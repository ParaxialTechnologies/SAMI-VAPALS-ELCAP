1. Description
 
 SAMI*18.0*12 SEQ #12 T3 adds 17 updates with various priorities, in a
 variety of places in VAPALS-ELCAP, include some bug fixes and some
 enhancements, as described below.
 
 The definitive source for the VAPALS-ELCAP application - codebase,
 package distributions (including this patch), and documentation - is
 at the following public Github repository:
 
 https://github.com/VA-PALS-ELCAP/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/
 
 These instructions are for your Vista environment’s sysadmin. As
 usual, please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it
 to your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.
 
 The 3 critical bugs fixed in T3 are:
 
 1. HL7: Make HL7 patient name match case insensitive
 
      issue: For patch 11, Mr. Marshall refactored the SAMIHL7 and
      SAMIOR routines to increase maintainability. But as sometimes
      happens during refactoring, he introduced a bug. In this case,
      in BLDARR^SAMIORM he moved a new command that should have been
      outside a loop inside the loop instead. This meant that instead
      of building an array of lines for each incoming ORM message, it
      instead kept overwriting line 1, so the resulting message
      received only included the last line of the message. This
      resulted in the creation of cryptic stub entries in patients'
      ORM subgraphs, which in turn resulted in blank lines in the
      Worklist.
 
      solution: The new command was moved outside the loop where it
      belongs, so all new incoming ORM messages will be processed
      and appear on the Worklist correctly. In the interests of fixing
      SAMIORM ASAP, cleanup of the existing stub entries will be left
      for patch 14, to leave time to find and develop the best
      solution.
      
      reported: 2021-06-07 by Murphy & Jirapatnakul.
 
 2. CT: nodules error in Internet Explorer
 
      issue: The radiologists are still using IE, and the CT form
      causes an error in IE. The radiologist started to enter a form
      with nodules and saved for later, but when he went back, the
      nodule grid was not expanded and could not be. When the form
      loads we get the following javascript error:
      
      jQuery.Deferred exception: Object doesn't support property or
      method 'includes' TypeError: Object doesn't support property or
      method 'includes'

      solution: fixed.
      
      reported: 2021-06-15 by Jirapatnakul.
 
 3. Missing CT Report: overhaul
      
      issue: The VAPALS-ELCAP research team and the Phoenix VAPALS
      team need to be able to use this report to work out which
      participants have not been contacted for the longest time, so
      they can contact them next. This will replace what is currently
      a manual tracking process involving spreadsheets.
      
      solution: Add the date from the last entry from the contact log
      on the Intake Form to this report & sort by it in reverse order,
      oldest to newest; add the log entry as a column; then move
      Enrollment Date to end of columns.
      
      reported: 2021-07-12 by Henschke.
 
 
 The 2 bugs fixed in the Manual Registration form are:
 
 4. HL7: Store patient names in ORM subgraphs in uppercase
 
      issue: Patch 11 introduced a change dating back to 2020-07 that
      capitalizes each name (first letter uppercase, rest lowercase)
      for storage in the VAPALS-ELCAP graph. Since patient names are
      converted to uppercase for lookups, conversions, and other
      calculations, this did not really affect users of the app, but
      it meant names can be stored inconsistently, which can be
      distracting for programmers and troubleshooters.
      
      solution: To simplify the graph, since patient names in CPRS and
      Vista are recorded in uppercase, patch 12 changes PID^SAMIORM to
      store them the same way. We're deferring the question of whether
      to convert all existing patient names in the graph until after
      discussion with the VA Phoenix team, so if such a conversion is
      written it will be part of patch 15.
      
      reported: 2021-03-04 by Morales.
 
 5. Man Reg: Integration Control Number block
      
      issue: VA staff do not use the ICN to identify patients.
      
      solution: ICN bloc removed.
      
      reported: 2021-01-22 by Morales. Jira VAP-486.
 
 
 The 3 enhancements related to parameterization include:
 
 6. Params: New parameter framework, set up defaults & site overrides
 
      issue: As VAPALS-ELCAP matures, it is becoming increasingly that
      the app needs the ability to vary field labels and behavior
      depending on the site, and maybe by user, institution, or other
      such variables. The app needs a parameterization framework to
      switch appearance and behavior based on parameters.
      
      solution: A new file SAMI PARAMETER DEFAULTS (311.14) was
      introduced to name parameters and set their defaults. New fields
      were added to file SAMI SITE (311.12) to override those defaults
      for any given site, a suite of initial parameters was created,
      and the SAMI routines were updated to respond to those params; a
      new web service - get params - was created so the forms can
      query the current parameter values.
      
      reported: 2021-03-02 by SAMI development team.
 
 7. Params: Field label parameterizations
      
      issue: Various fields on the SAMI forms are good candidates for
      having parameterized labels, such as references to social
      security # (instead of medical record #) or to veterans (instead
      of patients/participants).
      
      solution: These labels were modified throughout SAMI to respond
      to parameter settings.
      
      reported: 2021-05-10 by Lilly.
 
 8. Params: Matching Report parameterization
 
      issue: Whether the Matching Report is an item on the Reports
      Menu should be controlled by parameter.
      
      solution: Parameter added and implemented to hide the Matching
      Report if site doesn't need or use it.
      
      reported: 2021-06-01 by Yaw.
 
 
 The 1 upgrade related to the SAMI graphstore structure is:
 
 9. Graphstore: Patients with same SSN in different sites
 
      issue: The initial database architecture for SAMI assumed each
      VAPALS-ELCAP instance would support only a single site, so
      social security numbers were assumed to be unique. When VAPALS-
      ELCAP was upgraded in SAMI 1.18.0.5+i5 to allow multiple sites
      to share an instance (aka multi-tenancy), as a side effect this
      SSN restriction inadvertently became a restriction that no two
      sites could have patients with the same SSN. This is a problem,
      because many veterans are served by multiple VA sites.
      
      solution: The restriction was changed to allow patients with the
      same SSN at multiple sites within the same VAPALS-ELCAP instance
      as a followup/completion of the multi-tenancy work.
      
      reported: 2021-04-27 by Rukavena.
 
 
 The 5 bug fixes related to the the Intake Form are:
 
 10. Intake: M execution error with long text on Intake Form
 
      issue: Long text (say 300 words or so) put into the change log
      field causes an M error.
      
      solution: Upgraded to handle about 6,000 characters or so in
      text box. (tested with opening of Tolstoy's War and Peace)
      
      reported: 2021-04-16 by Jirapatnakul.
 
 11. Intake: Reason for Change block hidden when inactive selected
 
      issue: The Reason for Change block of fields were only appearing
      when the patient was set to active. When changed to inactive,
      the block disappeared, even though the same fields apply then.
      This led to a 2021-05-17 request by Hanschke & Jirapatnakul to
      add four fields related to the reason for the change. When
      DiNatale figured out that the request overlapped with the
      existing but hidden fields, the group agreed for now to just fix
      the bug with the disappearing fields.
      
      solution: The form was changed to show the block of fields even
      when the patient is set to inactive.
      
      reported: 2021-05-17 by Jirapatnakul. 2021-06-15 by DiNatale.
 
 12. Intake: Make participants inactive by default
 
      issue: The Active/Inactive field is required, but initially it
      was not, which led to the creation of some patients added to the
      current database with this field set neither way. How should
      such patients by treated? This affected the contents of the
      Inactive Report added in sami 1.18.0.11+i11. The previous
      default behavior was that such ambiguous patients were not shown
      on the Inactive Report, even though based on the intent of that
      report they really should have been.
      
      solution: SAMI has been changed to treat ambiguous patients as
      inactive, to ensure they show up on the Inactive Report, so
      nurse navigators and VAPALS coordinators can clearly see they
      need followup action to resolve their status.
      
      reported: 2021-06-24 by Jirapatnakul.
 
 13. Intake: New fields in inactive block: deceased, date of death
      
      issue: Upon review of the solution to issue 11, the VAPALS-ELCAP
      research team agreed we still need to add two new fields to
      fully document the possible reasons for a participant becoming
      inactive specifically if they died and if so when.
      
      solution: New fields added.
      
      reported: 2021-07-07 by Yip.
 
 14. Intake: CT Appointment field label falsely flagged as required
 
      issue: The CT Appointment field label includes the asterisk that
      indicates it is a required field, but it is not and should not
      be.
      
      solution: Asterisk removed to avoid misleading users.
      
      reported: 2021-06-15 by DiNatale.
 
 
 3 bug fixes related to the other forms are:
 
 15. Background: Systolic/Diastolic field definition
 
      issue: In the Hypertension block, the Systolic/Diastolic field
      was defined as numeric, with decimal requirements, which is not
      the correct format for this type of data.
      
      solution: The input transform for the field was changed from
      numeric to free text.
      
      reported: 2021-05-27 by Hanschke.
 
 16. PET: Past Followup dates
 
      issue: The Follow-up Dates field would not allow entry of past
      dates. This is a big problem for back-entering data about
      participants' past activities.
      
      solution: The restriction was removed.
      
      reported: 2021-06-10 by Henschke & Jirapatnakul.
 
 17. Biopsy: Refine Molecular Testing block
      
      issue: The Molecular Testing block of fields needs to be revised
      to better reflect the needed data.
      
      solution: Rename Other field to Other Tests; remove radio
      buttons No, Negative, and Positive.
      
      reported: 2021-05-24 by Henschke & Jirapatnakul.

3. Backup instructions
 
 It is important when installing packages to back up the existing
 package elements that are about to be changed, so that if anything
 goes wrong with the install, these package elements can be restored.
 For this patch, it's M routines and www files we will back up.
 
 
 3.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user
 
   This step assumes you type a dzdo or sudo to do this; here the
   symbol $DEMAND will stand for whichever command you use. If your
   configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
   configuration:
 
    $ $DEMAND su - osehra
 
 
 3.2. Prepare install directory
   
   Create install and backup directories
 
    $ mkdir -p ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.12/t3/back/www/
 
 
 3.3. Back up www files
    
    Back up existing www files that will be overwritten by this
    install. Do this by copying the www directory to the install
    backup directory:
    
    $ cp -r ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/* \
      ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.12/t3/back/www/
    $ 
 
 
 3.4. Enter M
    
    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the csession command on Cache or the mumps command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:
 
    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals
    
    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS
    
    >
 
 
    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir
    
    >
 
 
 3.5. Sign into Vista
    
    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:
 
    > do ^XUP
    
    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.
    
    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100
    
    Select OPTION NAME:
    >
 
 
 3.6. Back up routines
    
    Back up existing VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten
    by this install. Do this by calling direct-mode interface ^%RO
    (routine out), selecting the list of routines to save, selecting
    sami-1.18.0.12-t3-back.ro to save to, and answering any other
    additional prompts.
    
    The prompts vary between M implementations, so be sure to follow
    the correct dialog for your imp. The routine names to save are
    listed below under each imp; copy the list and paste it at the
    Routine prompt. At the final Routine prompt, press return to
    indicate the list of routines is done.

 5.5. Install the www files
 
 At this point in the install process, the VAPALS-ELCAP routines have
 been updated, but the corresponding www files have not. Those www
 files must first be installed.
 
 VA VAPALS-ELCAP sysadmins should follow step 5.5.1. Non-VA sysadmins
 should follow step 5.5.2.
 
 
   5.5.1. For VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems
   
   The VA firewall blocks access to the official VAPALS-ELCAP Github
   repository, so VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems do not maintain clones of
   that repo. Instead, they manually copy the www files into place by
   running these commands:
 
    $ rm -rf ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/*
    $ cp -r ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.12/t3/www/* \
      ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/
   
   
   5.5.2. For Non-VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems
   
   Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date
   clones of the official Github repository. Performing a git pull
   from that repo will automatically update the system's live www
   files, which are accessed via a symlink to the clone's files. Run
   these commands:
   
    $ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/
    $ git pull
 
 
 
 5.6. Activate the www files and exit M
 
 Both the VAPALS-ELCAP routines and www files have been updated at
 this point, but the routines are using cached copies of the www
 files. This step refreshes that cache to activate the www files.
 
 
   5.6.1. Enter M
   
    Repeat step 3.4 to enter M.
   
   
   5.6.2. Sign into Vista
 
    Repeat step 3.5 to sign into Vista.
 
 
   5.6.3. Rebuild M-Web's cached www files
   
    To improve performance, M-Web maintains cached copies of the HTML
    templates used by its services, so every time we update those
    HTML files in Unix, we must also direct M-Web to update its cached
    copies.
 
    > do CLRWEB^SAMIADMN
    
    >
 
 
   5.6.4. Exit M
 
    > halt
    $
 
 
 
 You now have VAPALS-ELCAP 1.18.0.12-t3+i12 (SAMI*18.0*12 SEQ #12 T3)
 installed in your M environment. The install is now complete. We
 recommend running tests of your VAPALS-ELCAP app to confirm the
 environment is operational and bug-free, before notifying users that
 VAPALS-ELCAP is ready for their use.
