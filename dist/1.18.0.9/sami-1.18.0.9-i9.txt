1. Description
 
 SAMI*18.0*9 SEQ #9 fixes the following bugs in the CT Eval,
 Intervention, Followup, and other forms. It is the first patch to
 VAPALS-ELCAP v18.0 to include updates to the html templates and
 associated web files; in addition to routine updates and distribution
 files, it ships completely new contents for the www/ directory. Bug
 fixes in this patch include:
 
 1.1. VAP-466: Intake Form field Pre-enrollment Comment
 
      problem: Field is required, but should be optional
 
      solution: Field made optional
 
 1.2. VAP-469,472: CT Evaluation Form field Followup Date
  
      problem: Validation forces date to be today or later. This
      interferes with entering old data. Date calculation done from
      current date instead of scan date.
 
      solution: Validation changed to be scan date or later.
 
 1.3. VAP-460: CT Evaluation Form copy forward
 
      problem: Other Abnormalities not copied forward to later forms.
 
      solution: Now it is.
 
 1.4. VAP-467: CT Evaluation Form field CTDI
 
      problem: CTDI (CT Dose Index) incorrectly labeled as CDTI.
 
      solution: Typo fixed.
 
 1.5. VAP-463: CT Evaluation Form three date fields
 
      problem: Baseline CT Date should be filled in on subsequent CT
      Eval forms. Most Recent Comparison CT Date should default to
      Previous CT Eval Date. Previous CT Eval Date should be based on
      dates of all previous CT forms.
 
      solution: Fixed
 
 1.6. VAP-460: Intervention Form copy forward
 
      problem: Copy forward not working for Intervention Form.
 
      solution: Fixed.
 
 1.7. VAP-473: Followup Form ordering information fields
 
      problem: Fields about ordering information, from Ordered By to
      Reported Asympotomatic at Time of Order, should be removed.
 
      solution: Removed.
 
 1.8. Followup Form submission error
 
      problem: When submitting Followup Form set to "Followup on CT
      communication," if no CT form exists, a JSON API error occurs.
 
      solution: A more helpful error message is displayed on a normal
      page.
 
 1.9. VAP-471: Enrollment & Activity Reports 
 
      problem: After changing the date range on the Enrollment and
      Activity reports, hitting Submit button returns to Login Page.
 
      solution: Fixed to just refresh the report.

3. Package-retrieval instructions
 
 The software for this patch is being released as KIDS package
 sami-1.18.0.9-i9.zip via git or via direct file transfer. These
 instructions are for your Vista environment's sysadmin. As usual,
 please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it to
 your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.
 
 
 3.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user
 
   This step assumes you type a sudo command to do this. If your
   configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
   configuration:
 
    $ sudo su - osehra
 
 
 3.2. Prepare the archive file
   
   Create install and backup directories
 
    $ mkdir -p ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.9/back/www/
 
 
   If using git to receive packages, update your VAPALS-ELCAP git
   repo, copy the VAPALS-ELCAP 1.18.0.9-i9 archive file to your
   install directory, and change directories to that install
   directory:
 
    $ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/
    $ git pull
    [...a successful git pull will result in a great deal of chatter...]
    $ cp dist/1.18.0.9/sami-1.18.0.9-i9.zip ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.9/
    
    This git method of receiving packages also completes half of the
    package install, because it updates all the html and associated
    web files, leaving only the KIDS package to be installed to
    complete the installation. If you are not prepared to proceed with
    the install, we recommend either waiting to retrieve the package
    via git until you are ready to proceed, or using the non-git
    method in advance and waiting to perform the git pull until the
    end of the pre-install steps.
 
 
   If NOT using git, download the archive from the patch webpage:
    
    http://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/sami-1.18.0.9-i9.html
    
    As the identity of the sysadmin Unix user, follow your usual
    procedure to transfer archive file sami-1.18.0.9-i9.zip to one of
    the sysadmin user directories and change to that directory.
    
    Then move the archive file to the osehra user install directory,
    change ownership of the archive file to osehra, assume the osehra
    user identity, and change directories to that install directory:
 
    $ sudo mv sami-1.18.0.9-i9.zip /home/osehra/run/in/sami/1.18.0.9/
    $ sudo chown osehra:osehra /home/osehra/run/in/sami/1.18.0.9/sami-1.18.0.9-i9.zip
    $ sudo su - osehra
 
 
 3.3. Expand the KIDS archive
   
   Change directories to the install directory, and expand the archive
   file, using the unix unzip command:
    
    $ cd ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.9/
    $ unzip sami-1.18.0.9-i9.zip
    Archive:  sami-1.18.0.9-i9.zip
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.9-i9-recipe.txt
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.9-i9.kid
      inflating: sami-1.18.0.9-i9.txt
      inflating: www/… [9 MB of www files]
    $ cd
    $ 
 
 
 
4. Pre-install instructions
 
 It is important when installing packages to back up the existing
 package elements that are about to be changed, so that if anything
 goes wrong with the install, these package elements can be restored.
 For this patch, it's M routines and www files we will back up.
 
 
 4.1. Enter M
    
    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the csession command on Cache or the mumps command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:
 
    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals
    
    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS
    
    >
 
 
    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir
    
    >
 
 
 4.2. Sign into Vista
    
    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:
 
    > do ^XUP
    
    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.
    
    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100
    
    You have 47 new messages.
    Select OPTION NAME:
    >
 
 
 4.3. Back up routines
    
    Back up existing VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten
    by this install. Do this by calling direct-mode interface ^%RO
    (routine out), selecting the list of routines to save, selecting
    sami-1.18.0.9-i9-back.ro to save to, and answering any other
    additional prompts.
    
    The prompts vary between M implementations, so be sure to follow
    the correct dialog for your imp. The routine names to save are
    listed below under each imp; copy the list and paste it at the
    Routine prompt. At the final Routine prompt, press return to
    indicate the list of routines is done.

 4.4. Back up www files
    
    Back up existing www files that will be overwritten by this
    install. Do this by exiting M and copying the www directory to the
    install backup directory:
    
    > halt
    $ cp -r ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/* \
      ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.9/back/www/
    $

 5.5. Install the www files
 
   If you use the git repo method of VAPALS-ELCAP package distribution
   and during this install you have already run the git pull command
   to update your sami repo clone, then the www files were installed
   when you did that.
   
   If you use the git repo method but have not yet run git pull, then
   run the cd and git pull commands:
   
    $ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/
    $ git pull
   
   If you DO NOT use the git repo distribution method, then instead
   run this cp command:
 
    $ cp -r ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.9/www/* \
      ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/www/
 
 
 
 5.6. Activate the www files and exit M
 
 
   5.6.1. Enter M
   
    Repeat step 4.1 to enter M.
   
   
   5.6.2. Sign into Vista
 
    Repeat step 4.2 to sign into Vista.
 
 
   5.6.3. Rebuild M-Web's cached www files
   
    To improve performance, M-Web maintains cached copies of the html
    templates used by its services, so every time we update those
    html files in Unix, we must also direct M-Web to update its cached
    copies.
 
    > do CLRWEB^SAMIADMN
    
    >
 
 
   5.6.4. Exit M
 
    > halt
    $
 
 
 
 You now have VAPALS-ELCAP 1.18.0.9-i9 (SAMI*18.0*9 SEQ #9) installed
 in your M environment. The install is now complete. We recommend
 running tests of your VAPALS-ELCAP app to confirm the environment is
 operational and bug-free, before notifying users that VAPALS-ELCAP is
 ready for their use.
