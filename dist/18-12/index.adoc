[[fix-crit-1]]
=== HL7: Make HL7 patient name match case insensitive

**Issue 21-103:** For 18.11, Mr. Marshall refactored the ++SAMIHL7++ and
++SAMIOR++ routines to increase maintainability. But as sometimes happens
during refactoring, he introduced a bug. In this case, in `BLDARR^SAMIORM` he
moved a new command that should have been outside a loop inside the loop
instead. This meant that instead of building an array of lines for each
incoming ORM message, it instead kept overwriting line{nbsp}1, so the resulting
message received only included the last line of the message. This resulted in
the creation of cryptic stub entries in patients’ ORM subgraphs, which in turn
resulted in blank lines in the Worklist.

**Solution:** The new command was moved outside the loop where it belongs, so
all new incoming ORM messages will be processed and appear on the Worklist
correctly. In the interests of fixing `SAMIORM` ASAP, cleanup of the existing
stub entries will be left for Patch 14, to leave time to find and develop the
best solution.

**Reported:** 2021-06-07 by Murphy and Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-crit-2]]
=== CT: nodules error in Internet Explorer

**Issue 21-109:** The radiologists are still using IE, and the CT form causes
an error in IE. The radiologist started to enter a form with nodules and saved
for later, but when he went back, the nodule grid was not expanded and could
not be. When the form loads we get the following JavaScript error:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   method 'includes' TypeError: Object doesn't support property or

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Solution:** Fixed.

**Reported:** 2021-06-15 by Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-crit-3]]
=== Missing CT Report: Overhaul

**Issue 21-122:** The VAPALS-ELCAP research team and the Phoenix VAPALS-ELCAP
team need to be able to use this report to work out which participants have not
been contacted for the longest time, so they can contact them next. This will
replace what is currently a manual tracking process involving spreadsheets.

**Solution:** Add the date from the last entry from the contact log on the
Intake form to this report, and sort by it in reverse order, oldest to newest;
add the log entry as a column; then move Enrollment Date to end of columns.

**Reported:** 2021-07-12 by Henschke.

[[fix-cte-1]]
=== CT Report: For emphysema, report says minimal but form says mild

**Issue 21-105:** Selecting ††_Mild_†† for ††_Emphysema_†† on the CT form
causes the CT report to list ††_Minimal_†† instead, which does not match. The
report should also say ††_Mild_††, so they agree.

**Solution:** Fixed.

**Reported:** 2021-06-10 by Jirapatnakul and Slaughter.

[[fix-cte-2]]
=== CT: Most Recent Comparative Study field set to current date

**Issue 21-124:** The ††__Most Recent Comparative Study__†† field currently
puts the date of the current CT form. The field should be the most recent
previous CT date, not the current date.

**Solution:** Fixed.

**Reported:** 2021-07-12 by Jirapatnakul and Slaughter.

[[fix-ure-1]]
=== User reports: Make all user reports sortable by any field

**Issue 21-140:** VAPALS-ELCAP users need to be able to sort each user
report by any field. They also need to be able to specify how many entries
they would like per page: 10, 25, 50, or 100. Users also need the ability to
search everything within any report, so you can search for dates or SSNs/MRNs,
for example. Users also need the ability to sort within another sort.

**Solution:** Done. This change removes the total number of entries from the
top of the page, but it is easy to see if number of entries per page is set
to 10.

**Reported:** 2021-08-10 by Henschke.

[[fix-man-1]]
=== HL7: Store patient names in ORM subgraphs in uppercase

**Issue 21-020:** 18.11 introduced a change dating back to 2020-07 that
capitalizes each name (first letter uppercase, rest lowercase) for storage in
the VAPALS-ELCAP graph. Since patient names are converted to uppercase for
lookups, conversions, and other calculations, this did not really affect users
of the app, but it meant names can be stored inconsistently, which can be
distracting for programmers and troubleshooters.

**Solution:** To simplify the graph, since patient names in CPRS and Vista are
recorded in uppercase, 18.12 changes `PID^SAMIORM` to store them the same
way. We're deferring the question of whether to convert all existing patient
names in the graph until after discussion with the VA Phoenix team, so if such
a conversion is written, it will be part of a future version.

**Reported:** 2021-03-04 by Morales.

[[fix-man-2]]
=== Man Reg: Integration Control Number block

**Issues 20-10 and 21-050:** VA staff do not use the ICN to identify patients.

**Solution:** ICN block removed.

**Reported:** 2021-01-22 by Morales. Jira VAP-486.

[[fix-param-1]]
=== Params: New parameter framework, set up defaults and site overrides

**Issue 21-017:** As VAPALS-ELCAP matures, it is becoming increasingly clear
that the app needs the ability to vary field labels and behavior depending on
the site, and maybe by user, institution, or other such variables. The app
needs a parameterization framework to switch appearance and behavior based on
parameters.

**Solution:** A new file ††SAMI PARAMETER DEFAULTS†† (311.14) was introduced to
name parameters and set their defaults. New fields were added to file ††SAMI
SITE†† (311.12) to override those defaults for any given site, a suite of
initial parameters was created, and the SAMI routines were updated to respond
to those params; a new web service---[ttsp]##get params##---was created so the
forms can query the current parameter values.

**Reported:** 2021-03-02 by SAMI development team.

[[fix-param-2]]
=== Params: Field label parameterizations

**Issue 21-057:** Various fields on the SAMI forms are good candidates for
having parameterized labels, such as references to social security number
(instead of medical record number) or to veterans (instead of
patients/participants).

**Solution:** These labels were modified throughout SAMI to respond to
parameter settings.

**Reported:** 2021-05-10 by Lilly.

[[fix-param-3]]
=== Params: Matching Report parameterization

**Issue 21-088:** Whether the Matching Report is an item on the Reports Menu
should be controlled by parameter.

**Solution:** Parameter added and implemented to hide the Matching Report if
site doesn't need or use it.

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Yaw.

[[fix-graph-1]]
=== Graphstore: Patients with same SSN in different sites

**Issue 21-051:** The initial database architecture for SAMI assumed each
VAPALS-ELCAP instance would support only a single site, so social security
numbers were assumed to be unique. When VAPALS-ELCAP was upgraded in SAMI 18.5
to allow multiple sites to share an instance (aka multi-tenancy), as a side
effect this SSN restriction inadvertently became a restriction that no two
sites could have patients with the same SSN. This is a problem, because many
veterans are served by multiple VA sites.

**Solution:** The restriction was changed to allow patients with the same SSN
at multiple sites within the same VAPALS-ELCAP instance as a
followup/completion of the multi-tenancy work.

**Reported:** 2021-04-27 by Rukavena.

[[fix-graph-2]]
=== Graphstore: Data export is missing fields

**Issue 21-127:** The VAPALS-ELCAP data dictionaries (DDs) are used to drive
the data export process, so when field definitions are revised or new fields
are added but the DDs are not updated, it can leave the export out of sync with
the actual data.

**Solution:** VAPALS-ELCAP includes manual processes to update the DDs, but
these have not been used since the original release, even though numerous
fields have been added and others modified. A future version of the app can use
our packaging tools to automatically run these updates for every SAMI package
that affects the definition of the form fields, to keep them up to date going
forward. But for 18.12, they must be run manually, as described in the install
instructions.

**Reported:** 2021-07-13 by Jirapatnakul and Yip.

[[fix-int-1]]
=== Intake: M execution error with long text on Intake Form

**Issue 21-046:** Long text (say 300 words or so) put into the change log field
causes an M error.

**Solution:** Upgraded to handle about 6,000 characters or so in text box
(tested with the opening of Tolstoy's __War and Peace__).

**Reported:** 2021-04-16 by Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-int-2]]
=== Intake: Reason for Change block hidden when inactive selected

**Issues 21-074 and 21-107:** The ††__Reason for Change__†† block of fields
were only appearing when the patient was set to active. When changed to
inactive, the block disappeared, even though the same fields apply then. This
led to a [nowrap]##2021-05-17## request by Henschke and Jirapatnakul to add
four fields related to the reason for the change. When DiNatale figured out
that the request overlapped with the existing but hidden fields, the group
agreed for now to just fix the bug with the disappearing fields.

**Solution:** The form was changed to show the block of fields even when the
patient is set to inactive.

**Reported:** 2021-05-17 by Jirapatnakul. 2021-06-15 by DiNatale.

[[fix-int-3]]
=== Intake: Make participants inactive by default

**Issue 21-112:** The ††__Active/Inactive__†† field is required, but initially
it was not, which led to the creation of some patients added to the current
database with this field set neither way. How should such patients by treated?
This affected the contents of the Inactive Report added in SAMI 18.11. The
previous default behavior was that such ambiguous patients were not shown on
the Inactive Report, even though based on the intent of that report they really
should have been.

**Solution:** SAMI has been changed to treat ambiguous patients as inactive, to
ensure they show up on the Inactive Report, so nurse navigators and VAPALS
coordinators can clearly see they need followup action to resolve their status.

**Reported:** 2021-06-24 by Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-int-4]]
=== Intake: New fields in inactive block: deceased, date of death

**Issue 21-114:** Upon review of the solution to <<fix-int-3,issue 21-112>>,
the VAPALS-ELCAP research team agreed we still need to add two new fields to
fully document the possible reasons for a participant becoming inactive
specifically if they died, and if so, when.

**Solution:** New fields added.

**Reported:** 2021-07-07 by Yip.

[[fix-int-5]]
=== Intake: CT Appointment field label falsely flagged as required

**Issue 21-108:** The CT Appointment field label includes the asterisk that
indicates it is a required field, but it is not and should not be.

**Solution:** Asterisk removed to avoid misleading users.

**Reported:** 2021-06-15 by DiNatale.

[[fix-int-6]]
=== Intake: Inactive reason left out of data export

**Issue 21-117:** Inactive reason needs to be included in export of Intake form
data.

**Solution:** <<fix-graph-2,The fix above to issue 21-127>> fixes this problem.

**Reported:** 2021-07-09 by Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-int-7]]
=== Intake: Blank Intake forms should be marked incomplete

**Issue 21-113:** Intake forms that are not filled out (if the user goes to
register a patient but doesn't fill out anything) are not marked as incomplete.
Intake forms should be incomplete by default.

**Solution:** Done.

**Reported:** 2021-06-24 by Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-inter-1]]
=== Intervention: Remove Clinical TNM Status (8th ed. modified) rows

**Issues 21-099 and 21-100:** Remove lines in form that refer to the 8th
edition modified Clinical TNM Status. The clinical team made this
request. There were two references in the intervention form: one under
treatment, one under Surgical Treatment.

**Solution:** Removed.

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Henschke.

[[fix-inter-2]]
=== Intervention: Changes to pulmonary function items

**Issues 21-097, 21-098 and 21-132:** Several changes to the pulmonary function
test items. That question, along with the results fields were moved towards the
top of the Intervention form under ††__Clinical staging based on__††. After the
change, the ††__Have you had a pulmonary function test?__†† and ††__No/Yes__††
boxes are on one line with the ††__FEV1 (L/s)__††, ††__FVC (L)__††, and
††__FEV1/FVC__†† fields on their own line followed by ††__Diffusion
capacity__†† on its own line. The ††__FEV1/FVC__†† field was added as an
uncalculated percentage.

**Solution:** Lines moved; new field added. The pulmonary-function test line
has been moved to under ††__Clinical Staging__††, then the ††__FEV1/FVC__††
boxes on the following row, and then the diffusion capacity on the next
row. However, in this version of the form the diffusion-capacity field
disappears if the browser window gets too narrow, and we do not yet know
why. This will have to be addressed in a future version.

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Henschke.

[[fix-inter-3]]
=== Intervention: Mediastinoscopy lines only appear when answer yes

**Issue 21-096:** Under Surgical Treatment Information ††__Was mediastinoscopy
performed?__††, the next two lines should be shown only if ††__Yes__†† is
selected.  These lines are about the procedure.

**Solution:** Lines made conditional.

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Henschke.

[[fix-inter-4]]
=== Intervention: Changes to VATS section under surgical treatment

**Issue 21-095:** Under ††__Surgical Treatment, Resection__††, move line with,
††__Was there a conversion of VATS to open?__†† to be on a line by itself below
the line with ††__Extent of surgery__††. Add a free text box after this
question titled ††__Reason__†† that is available no matter which answer is
chosen.

**Solution:** Text box added; question moved.

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Henschke.

[[fix-inter-5]]
=== Intervention: Remove section titled Summary of Interventions

**Issue 21-094:** Under abnormalities, remove section titled ††__Summary of
Interventions__††. It is redundant.

**Solution:** Section removed.

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Henschke.

[[fix-inter-6]]
=== Intervention: Add note to Lesion Site dropdown

**Issue 21-093:** At top under ††__Treatment__††, in ††__Lesion Site__††
dropdown, add a note that says, ††__If multiple sites, select other and
specify__††.

**Solution:** Note added.

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Henschke.

[[fix-inter-7]]
=== Intervention: When Radiation or Chemotherapy is Treatment, change date label

**Issue 21-092:** Under ††__Treatment__††, when ††__Radiation Therapy__†† or
††__Chemotherapy__†† are selected in the ††__Treatment Option__†† drop down,
change label of next box over to ††__Treatment Start Date__††.

**Solution:** Done.

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Henschke.

[[fix-inter-8]]
=== Intervention: Add field for length under Pathology tumor size

**Issue 21-106:** Pathology tumor size: include additional field for length.

**Solution:** Field added.

**Reported:** 2021-06-10 by Jirapatnakul and Yip.

[[fix-inter-9]]
=== Intervention: Several changes in Surgical Treatment section

**Issue 21-102:** Add discharge data fields to ††__Surgical Treatment__††
section, add a field and reformat ††__T Staging__†† section, add
††__Adenocarcinoma Histology__†† section, reformatting of ††__Evidence of
Metastasis__†† section.

**Solution:** Done.

**Reported:** 2021-06-10 by Jirapatnakul and Henschke.

[[fix-inter-10]]
=== Intervention: Change tab name to Follow-Up

**Issue 21-091:** Due to other changes in the Intervention form, the tab
labeled ††__Intervention and Follow-Up__†† no longer had any intervention
information in it.

**Solution:** Tab name changed.

**Reported:** _ca._ 2021-06-15 by DiNatale.

[[fix-bio-1]]
=== Biopsy: Refine Molecular Testing block

**Issue 21-085:** The Molecular Testing block of fields needs to be revised to
better reflect the needed data.

**Solution:** Rename ††__Other__†† field to ††__Other Tests__††; remove radio
buttons ††_no_††, ††_negative_†† and ††_positive_††.

**Reported:** 2021-05-24 by Henschke and Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-bio-2]]
=== Biopsy: Mediastinoscopy section redundant and EBUS missing

**Issue 21-090:** The fields in the ††__Mediastinoscopy__†† section are the
same as the fields in the ††__Biopsy__†† section, which makes the form longer
and more confusing than it needs to be. Mediastinoscopy should just be another
type of procedure. Also, EBUS is missing from the list of procedures. Under
††__Type of Procedure__††, when ††__Biopsy Performed__†† is checked
††__yes__††, add options for mediastinoscopy and EBUS after
††__Bronchoscopy__††. Remove ††__Was a mediastinoscopy performed?__†† and
related section.

**Solution:** Done

**Reported:** 2021-06-01 by Henschke.

[[fix-bio-3]]
=== Biopsy: Needs a Cancelled option with text box for reason

**Issue 21-078:** Form needs a new field ††__Was a biopsy performed?__†† with
possible answers ††_Yes_††, ††_N_†† or ††_Cancel_††. Form also needs a
††__Cancellation Reason__†† text box. If biopsy cancelled, make all fields
optional.  If not, still show all the fields, and still make them optional.

**Solution:** Done.

**Reported:** 2021-05-18 by Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-bkg-1]]
=== Background: Systolic/Diastolic field definition

**Issue 21-087:** In the ††__Hypertension__†† block, the
††__Systolic/Diastolic__†† field was defined as numeric, with decimal
requirements, which is not the correct format for this type of data.

**Solution:** The input transform for the field was changed from numeric to
free text.

**Reported:** 2021-05-27 by Hanschke.

[[fix-pet-1]]
=== PET: Past Followup dates

**Issue 21-104:** The ††__Follow-up Dates__†† field would not allow entry of
past dates. This is a big problem for back-entering data about participants'
past activities.

**Solution:** The restriction was removed.

**Reported:** 2021-06-10 by Henschke and Jirapatnakul.

[[fix-fol-1]]
=== Followup: Not all of the Followup note is being sent to Vista.

**Issue 21-047:** Only the first item of communication detail is being sent.

**Solution:** Handling of text boxes improved to send complete text.

**Reported:** 2021-04-22 by Murphy.

[[backup-instructions]]
== Backup instructions

It is important when installing packages to back up the existing package
elements that are about to be changed, so that if anything goes wrong with the
install, these package elements can be restored. For this package, we will back
up M{nbsp}routines, `form-fields` files, and `www` files.

[[be-osehra]]
=== Assume the identity of your +osehra+ Unix user

This step assumes you use a `dzdo` or `sudo` command to do this; here, the
symbol `$DEMAND` will stand for whichever command you use. If your
configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
configuration:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ $DEMAND su - osehra
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[prep-installdir]]
=== Prepare install directory

Create install and backup directories:

// $ REPO=~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github
// $ cd ~/run/in/sami
// $ mv 1.18.0.12 18.12
// $ cd 18.12
// # The last three commands may be replaced with
// #  $ cd ~/run/in/sami/18.12
// # if no rneame is done.
// $ mkdir back
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mv ~/run/in/sami/1.18.0.12 ~/run/in/sami/18.12
$ (cd ~/run/in/sami/18.12; mkdir -p back/form-fields back/www)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[backup-www]]
=== Back up `form-fields` and `www` files

Back up existing `form-fields` and `www` files that will be overwritten by this
install. Do this by copying the `form-fields` and `www` directories to the
install backup directories:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs
$ cp -r form-fields/* ~/run/in/sami/18.12/back/form-fields/
$ cp -r www/* ~/run/in/sami/18.12/back/www
$ cd
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// $ cp -r $REPO/docs/{form-fields,www} ./back/
// # No cd is necessary at the end. See below.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Preparing for the archive creation:
// $ REPO=~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github
// $ cd ~/run/out/sami/18.12
// $ cp -r $REPO/docs/{form-fields,www} ./
// $ zip -r sami-18.12.zip sami-18.12*.{kid,txt} form-fields www
// $ rm -rf form-fields www
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[enter-m]]
=== Enter M

At the Unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using the
`csession` command on Caché or the `mumps` command on YottaDB/GT.M:

[[enter-m-cache]]
==== On Caché

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[signin]]
=== Sign into Vista

At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your access code,
and then just press return at the [ttsp nowrap]##OPTION NAME## prompt to return
to direct mode. This sets up your authentication variables. Here's a sample
capture of this step:

[[backup]]
=== Back up routines

Back up existing VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten by this
install. Do this by calling direct-mode interface `^%RO` (routine out),
selecting the list of routines to save, selecting +sami-18.12.back.ro+ to save
to, and answering any other additional prompts.

The prompts vary between M implementations, so be sure to follow the correct
dialog for yours. The routine names to save are listed below under each
implementation; copy the list and paste it at the +Routine+ prompt. At the
final +Routine+ prompt, press return to indicate the list of routines is done.

In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also provide a
+Description+ and press return at the +Parameters+ and [ttsp]##Printer Format##
prompts to accept the defaults of +WNS+ and +No+, respectively:

[[install-www]]
=== Install the `form-fields` and `www` files

At this point in the install process, the VAPALS-ELCAP routines have been
updated, but the corresponding `form-fields` and `www` files have not; these
must first be installed.

VA VAPALS-ELCAP sysadmins should follow the <<www-for-va-instance,††__For VA
VAPALS-ELCAP systems__††>> step. Non-VA sysadmins should follow the
<<www-for-non-va-instance,††__For Non-VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems__††>> step.

[[www-for-va-instance]]
==== For VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems

The VA firewall blocks access to the official VAPALS-ELCAP GitHub repository,
so VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems do not maintain clones of that repo. Instead, they
manually copy the `form-fields` and `www` files into place by running these
commands:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs
$ rm -rf form-fields/*
$ rm -rf www/*
$ cp -r ~/run/in/sami/18.12/form-fields/* form-fields/
$ cp -r ~/run/in/sami/18.12/www/* www/
$ cd
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[www-for-non-va-instance]]
==== For Non-VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems

Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date clones of the
official GitHub repository. Performing a [ttsp nowrap]##git pull## from that
repo will automatically update the system's live `form-fields` and `www` files
(the `www` files are accessed via a symlink to the clone's files), Run these
commands:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github
$ git pull
$ cd
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// eval::[Section.setlevel(2)]

[[activate-www]]
=== Activate the `form-fields` and `www` files and exit M

Both the VAPALS-ELCAP routines and `www` files have been updated at this point,
but the routines are using cached copies of the `form-fields` and `www` files;
this step refreshes those copies.

[[enter-m-3]]
==== Enter M

Repeat the instructions in <<enter-m,††__Enter M__††>> to re-enter M.

[[signin-2]]
==== Sign into Vista

Repeat the instructions in <<signin,††__Sign into Vista__††>> to sign into
Vista.

[[rebuild]]
==== Rebuild M-Web's cached `form-fields` and `www` files

To improve performance, M-Web maintains cached copies of the `form-fields`
files, which are the data dictionaries for the fields on all the VAPALS-ELCAP
forms. It also maintains cached copies of the HTML templates used by its
services. Every time we update those data-dictionary or HTML files in Unix, we
must also direct M-Web to update its cached copies of the data dictionaries and
clear its cached copies of the HTML files.

Just copy and paste the following list of commands into the direct-mode prompt:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
set SAMIDIR="/home/osehra/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/form-fields/"
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"background.tsv","form fields - background")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"biopsy.tsv","form fields - biopsy")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"ct-evaluation.tsv","form fields - ct evaluation")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"follow-up.tsv","form fields - follow up")

do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"register.tsv","form fields - register")
