3. Prepare for installation

 This involves creating a directory to work in, running a script to
 back up certain datafiles and web-application files, and then going
 through steps to back up M routines that will be replaced by the
 patch.


 3.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user

   This step assumes you type a dzdo or sudo to do this; here the
   symbol $DEMAND will stand for whichever command you use. If your
   configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
   configuration:

    $ $DEMAND su - osehra
    $


 3.2. Prepare install directory

   Execute the following commands (`$` simply means your command-line
   prompt). They create a shell variable, and then creates the
   directory or, if it already exists, removes previous installation
   files before proceeding.

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-14/t1
    $ mkdir -p $INDIR \
       || rm -rf $INDIR/sami-*.{kid,txt} $INDIR/{form-fields,www}
    $ cd $INDIR

 3.3. Download and prepare the archive file

   You may safely download the archive file sami-18-14-t1.zip in advance
   of the actual install. In the following text, "[now]" represents a
   time stamp representing your current time, and "[bits/sec]" is a
   data rate and "[time]" is how long the file took to transfer (both
   of which vary based on the user's network conditions).

    $ wget 'http://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/sami-18-14-t1.zip'
    --[now]--  http://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/sami-18-14-t1.zip
    Resolving vistaexpertise.net (vistaexpertise.net)... 208.113.153.6
    Connecting to vistaexpertise.net (vistaexpertise.net)|208.113.153.6|:80... connected.
    HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK

    [now] ([bits/sec]) - ‘sami-18-14-t1.zip’ saved [2588741/2588741]

   Then unzip the archive file with the following command.

    $ unzip sami-18-14-t1.zip
    Archive:  sami-18-14-t1.zip
      [... 539 files in archive, about 9.0 Mb ...]
    $ _

 3.4. Back up files

   Several files will be overwritten by this install. This step backs
   those up as a safety measure to your working directory.

    $ ./step1-backup
    Backing up files ... done.
    $ _



 3.5 Install web-application files

    At this point in the install process, the VAPALS-ELCAP routines
    have been updated, but the corresponding web-application files
    have not; these must first be installed. On VA VAPALS-ELCAP
    systems, the output will look like this:

     $ ./step2-install
     Updating files ... done.
     $ _

    Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date
    clones of the official GitHub repository, and this script will
    have different output.

     $ ./step2-install
     Found a Git repository; pulling updates.
     [... output varies ...]
     Done.
     $ _



 3.6. Back up M routines

   Before the installation, we also need to back up existing
   VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten by this install. To
   do this, you will have to start a Caché or YottaDB session
   (depending on your particular installation), sign in to Vista, and
   then call the direct-mode interface ^%RO (“routine out”).

   We have made efforts to display accurate instructions, but there
   are likely to be minor differences between implementations. Be sure
   to follow the correct dialog for your implementation.

  3.6.1. Enter M

    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the 'csession' command on Cache or the 'mumps' command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:

    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals

    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS

    >


    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir

    >


  3.6.2. Sign into Vista

    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:

    > do ^XUP

    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.

    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

    Select OPTION NAME:
    >


  3.6.3. List of routines

    The routine names to save are listed below; you may copy the list
    and paste it at the appropriate Routine prompt. At the final
    Routine prompt, press return to indicate the list of routines is
    done.

SAMIUR
SAMIUR2
SAMIURUL

  3.6.4. Run the backup

    Creating the routine backup file differs by implementation.

    On Caché
    --------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a
    warning message (specifically, the routine name will have '[???]'
    after it, and the line [does not exist] after it). These messages
    can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
    respectively:

     >do ^%RO

     Routine output (please use %ROMF for object code output)
     Routines(s): SAMIUR
     Routines(s): SAMIUR2
     Routines(s): SAMIURUL
     Routines(s):

     Description: SAMI 18*14 SEQ #14 T1 routine backup

     Output routines to
     Device: /home/osehra/run/in/sami/18-14/t1/back/sami-18-14-t1-back.ro
     Parameters? ("WNS") =>
     Printer Format? No => No
     SAMIUR.INT    SAMIUR2.INT   SAMIURUL.INT
     >_

    On YottaDB/GT.M
    ---------------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the
    routine name not appearing under the input line, and won't count
    towards the number of routines. These can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Header Label and press return at the Strip comments
    prompt to accept the default of No:

     >do ^%RO

     Routine Output - Save selected routines into RO file.

     Routines: SAMIUR
     SAMIUR
     Current total of 1 routines.

     Routines: SAMIUR2
     SAMIUR2
     Current total of 2 routines.
     
     Routines: SAMIURUL
     SAMIURUL
     Current total of 3 routines.
     

     Routine:

     Output device <terminal>: /home/osehra/run/in/sami/18-14/t1/back/sami-18-14-t1-back.ro

     Strip comments <No>?:
     SAMIUR  SAMIUR2   SAMIURUL

     Total of 2137 lines in 3 routines.

     >_

    You'll remain in the M environment for the next section.

 4.2. Activating web-application files

   Both the VAPALS-ELCAP routines and web-application files have been
   updated at this point, but the routines are using cached copies of
   the web-application files; this step refreshes those copies.

  4.2.1. Refresh web-application cache

    To improve performance, M-Web maintains cached copies of the data
    dictionaries for the fields on all the VAPALS-ELCAP forms, and of
    the HTML templates used by its services. Every time we update
    those files in Unix, we must also direct M-Web to update its
    cache.

    To do so, exit the Installation menu by hitting carriage return
    (possibly more than once) to get to a direct-mode prompt, and then
    copy and paste the following list of commands into that prompt:

set SAMIDIR="/home/osehra/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/form-fields/"
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"background.tsv","form fields - background")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"biopsy.tsv","form fields - biopsy")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"ct-evaluation.tsv","form fields - ct evaluation")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"follow-up.tsv","form fields - follow up")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"intake.tsv","form fields - intake")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"intervention.tsv","form fields - intervention")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"pet-evaluation.tsv","form fields - pet evaluation")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"register.tsv","form fields - register")
do CLRWEB^SAMIADMN
do INIT2GPH^SAMICTD2

    The output is shown below (where "[job]" is a job number displayed
    by the PRSTSV routine):

  4.2.2. Exit M

    Run the following command to exit the M environment:

     > halt
     $ _

   You now have VAPALS-ELCAP 18.14 (SAMI*18.0*14 SEQ #14) installed in
   your M environment. The install is now complete. We recommend
   running tests of your VAPALS-ELCAP app to confirm the environment
   is operational and bug-free, before notifying users that
   VAPALS-ELCAP is ready for their use.
