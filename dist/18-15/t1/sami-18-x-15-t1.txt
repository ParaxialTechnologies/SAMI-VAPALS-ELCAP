1. Description

 SAMI 18-x-15-t1 adds 12 updates (five high-priority, five
 medium-priority, and two low-priority), most of them changes to the
 CT Eval form and the CT Report.  The definitive source for the
 VAPALS-ELCAP application - codebase, package distributions (including
 this one), and documentation - is at the following public Github
 repository:

 https://github.com/VA-PALS-ELCAP/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/

 The most up-to-date and accurate version of this file can be found at

 https://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/18-x-15/t1/

 These instructions are for your Vista environment’s sysadmin. As
 usual, please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it
 to your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.

 The changes in this patch are:


 1.1. CT Evaluation Form: Make lymph node map a little bigger

   issue 21-149 (medium priority): Make the lymph node map in the Neck
   and Mediastinal section bigger if possible.

   solution: Enlarged the lymph-node map.

   reported: 2021-07-25 by Chenoweth.


 1.2. CT Evaluation Form: Revert change for nodule status options

   issue 21-128 (medium priority): This partially reverts an earlier
   request. Current behavior of these two nodule status options is to
   blank out fields in the nodule table; desired behavior is to keep
   the information (as maybe later scans will have the nodules). The
   fields should only be grayed out for "Prev seen, resolved" or "Prev
   seen, not a nodule", not for other choices.

   solution: Changed to desired behavior.

   reported: 2021-07-13 by Yip.


 1.3. CT Evaluation Form: Automates resolution of nodule status

   issue 21-129 (medium priority): Automatically set the nodule status
   to resolved if the "is it new?" option is set to "Prev seen,
   resolved."

   solution: Changed to desired behavior.

   reported: 2021-07-13 by Yip.


 1.4. CT Evaluation Form: Comparative and prior scans should be
      visible for baseline exams

   issue 21-198 (medium priority): Previously, comparative and prior
   scan fields were not visible when type of exam was baseline.

   solution: Changed to desired behavior.

   reported: 2021-10-25 by Henschke.


 1.5. CT Evaluation Form and CT Report: Add "right" and "left" for
      lymph nodes N10-N14

   issue 21-170 (high priority): In the Neck and Mediastinal section
   on the form add right and left for lymph nodes N10-N14. Extend CT
   Report to handle new form fields.

   solution: Added form-fields and checkboxes.

   reported: 2021-09-07 by Henschke


 1.6. CT Report: The lymph-node station does not carry over to the CT
      Report

   issue 21-148 (high priority): Lymph-node stations are reported in
   the Neck and Mediastinal section on the form but that information
   is not included in the CT Report.

   solution: Add lymph node stations to CT Report.

   reported: 2021-07-25 by Chenoweth.


 1.7. CT Report: There is an extra space in front of Description

   issue 21-150 (low priority): There is an extra space in front of
   Description at the top of the CT Report.

   solution: Removed extra space.

   reported: 2021-07-25 by Chenoweth.


 1.8. CT Report: Comparative and prior scans should not include
      current date

   issue 21-167 (medium priority): Current date should not be included
   in comparative scans and prior scans in report or CT Eval.

   solution: Changed to desired behavior.

   reported: 2021-09-02 by Phoenix Team.


 1.9. CT Report: Pleural effusion bug in CT report

   issue 21-135 (high priority): Pleural effusions information was
   translating incorrectly into the CT report.

   solution: Corrected translation.

   reported: 2021-08-03 by Slaughter.


 2.##. CT Report: Wording change

   issue 21-176 (low priority): Remove the word "above" in
   "Impression" section.

   solution: Removed word from CT Report. Must run INIT2GPH^SAMICTD2
   to get the fix which will be in the Post-install. No extra action
   required by system administrator.

   reported: 2021-09-16 by Murphy.


 3.##. CT Report: Change wording for empty CAC or emphysema

   issue 21-192 (high priority): In Emphysema and Coronary Artery
   Calcification, if nothing is entered, then in the report, indicate
   "Emphysema score not provided" and "Coronary Artery Calcification
   score not provided."

   solution: Changed report translation.

   reported: 2021-10-11 by Henschke.


 4.##. Intake-but-no-CT Report: Include patients who had CTs, but none
       since enrollment

   issue 21-160 (high priority): To make sure all participants have a
   CT scan in the program those who had CT scans before enrollment
   need to be on this report.

   solution: Add active patients who have not had a CT scan since
   enrollment.

   reported: 2021-08-23 by Henschke.


 5.##. Infrastructure: Improve support for parameterization by system
       and site

   issue 21-194 (high priority): Some sites or organizations will need
   different wording or other differences from the default. (For example,
   ELCAP protocols vs Lung-Rads.)

   solution: Developed new parameters to customize VAPALS.

7. Prepare for installation

 This involves creating a directory to work in, running a script to
 back up certain datafiles and web-application files, and then going
 through steps to back up M routines that will be replaced by the
 patch.


 7.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user

   This step assumes you type a dzdo or sudo to do this; here the
   symbol $DEMAND will stand for whichever command you use. (Also, in
   all the command-line examples below, '$' simply means your
   command-line prompt.) If your configuration is different, please
   adjust this step to match your configuration:

    $ $DEMAND su - osehra
    $


 7.2. Prepare install directory

   If this is your first time installling this, execute the following
   commands.  They create a shell variable, and then creates the work
   directory and sets it as your current directory.

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-x-15/t1
    $ mkdir -p $INDIR
    $ cd $INDIR

   If you've already tried installing this once, you can use the
   following commands instead:

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-x-15/t1
    $ cd $INDIR
    $ rm -rf ./sami*.{txt,kid} ./*webapp*


 7.3. Download and prepare the archive file

   You may safely download the archive file sami-18-x-15-t1.zip in advance
   of the actual install. In the following text, "[now]" represents a
   time stamp representing your current time, and "[bits/sec]" is a
   data rate and "[time]" is how long the file took to transfer (both
   of which vary based on the user's network conditions).

    $ wget --no-verbose 'https://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/18-x-15/t1/sami-18-x-15-t1.zip'
    {now} URL:https://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/18-x-15/t1/sami-18-x-15-t1.zip [{size}/{size}] -> "sami-18-x-15-t1.zip" [1]
    $ _

   Then unzip the archive file with the following command.

    $ unzip sami-18-x-15-t1.zip
    Archive:  sami-18-x-15-t1.zip
      ...
    $ _


 7.4. Install web-application files

    At this point, the web-application files must be installed. This is done
    with a script that backs up the affected directories before installing
    anything, then upgrades the web-application files.

     $ ./upgrade-webapp
     Backing up files to ./.webapp-backup:
     [... lists of files backed up ...]
     Compressing the backup:
     [... lists of files being compressed ...]
     Cleaning up.
     Done with backup of webapp files.

     Updating from ./webapp-upgrade-files ...
     [... lists of files being updated ...]
     Done with install.

     You may now proceed with the KIDS installation.
     $ _

    Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date clones of
    the official GitHub repository, and this script will have different output.

     $ ./upgrade-webapp
     Backing up files to ./.webapp-backup:
     [... lists of files backed up ...]
     Compressing the backup:
     [... lists of files being compressed ...]
     Cleaning up.
     Done with backup of webapp files.

     Found a valid Git repository; pulling updates ...
     [... output varies ...]
     Done with install.
     $ _


 7.5. Back up M routines

   Before the installation, we also need to back up existing
   VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten by this install. To
   do this, you will have to start a Cache or YottaDB session
   (depending on your particular installation), sign in to Vista, and
   then call the direct-mode interface ^%RO ("routine out").

   We have made efforts to display accurate instructions, but there
   are likely to be minor differences between implementations. Be sure
   to follow the correct dialog for your implementation.


  7.5.1. Enter M

    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the 'csession' command on Cache or the 'mumps' command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:

    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals

    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS

    >


    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir

    >


  7.5.2. Sign into Vista

    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:

    > do ^XUP

    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.

    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

    Select OPTION NAME:
    >


  7.5.3. List of routines

    The routine names to save are listed below; you may copy the list
    and paste it at the appropriate Routine prompt. At the final
    Routine prompt, press return to indicate the list of routines is
    done.

SAMIADMN
SAMICAS3
SAMICTD2
SAMICTT0
SAMICTT3
SAMICTUL
SAMICUL
SAMIHOM4
SAMIHUL
SAMIMOV
SAMINOT1
SAMINOT2
SAMINOT3
SAMINUL
SAMIPARM
SAMIPAT
SAMIUR
SAMIUR2
SAMIURUL


  7.5.4. Run the backup

    Creating the routine backup file differs by implementation.

    On Caché
    --------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a
    warning message (specifically, the routine name will have '[???]'
    after it, and the line [does not exist] after it). These messages
    can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
    respectively:

     >do ^%RO

    ---------------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the
    routine name not appearing under the input line, and won't count
    towards the number of routines. These can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Header Label and press return at the Strip comments
    prompt to accept the default of No:
