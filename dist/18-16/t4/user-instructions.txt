After install, in the vapals programming environment:
DO SITEIDX^SAMIMOV
It won't look like anything happened, but later steps won't be possible
without this step.

In your browser, with the correct information for your site inserted in the
url in place of "vapalsyotta.fiscientific.org", go to
http://vapalsyotta.fiscientific.org:9080/gtree/%25wd(17.040801,%22B%22)

On that page, look for 
|--patient-lookup 
|  |--69 

The number may or may not be 69. Replace the site information
in the following url the same way you did before and if the number is
different replace the 69 with the correct number in the following url.
http://vapalsyotta.fiscientific.org:9080/gtree/%25wd(17.040801,69,%22siteid%22)

If it all worked right, you should see a list of patients separated by
site. You'll notice duplicates because they'll have two or more numbers
under their name.

Choose a Site to move the duplicates to. If you don't have another site
available follow the instructions here:

In the vapals programming environment
> DO DEDUP^SAMIMOV

Here's an example of the interface.

Pick the FROM Site -
Select SAMI SITE: PHI  PHILADELPHIA, PA VAMC     PHI  PA  VAMC  642  
Pick the TO Site -
Select SAMI SITE: SEA  PUGET SOUND HCS     SEA  WA  VAMC  663  
Confirm removing duplicates from  PHI by moving them to SEA? YES

Refresh the last browser page. All of the duplicates should be moved to the
selected site.
