[[desc]]
== Description

{nmsp} {version} adds two high-priority updates to accomodate Mt.{nbsp}Sinai's
workflow as well as updates to allow single sign-on or to improve output of
reports.

The definitive source for the {appname} application---codebase, package
distributions (including this one), and documentation---is a
https://github.com/ParaxialTechnologies/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/[public GitHub
repository].

These instructions are for your Vista environment's sysadmin. As usual, please
capture the complete dialog of your install and send it to your {appname}
support team.

The changes in this patch are:

[options="compact"]
* Insert clinical information string in CT Eval form (high-priority,
  <<issue-a,A-1a, high priority>>)
* Provide support for user-controlled MRN and Study ID (<<issue-b,A-2 and A-3,
  high priority>>)
* Login: Implement single sign-on (<<issue-c,21-218>>)
* Logout: Upon sign-out, redirect to the correct web page (<<issue-d,21-221>>)
* Include name and last5 in every CSV file on every row (<<issue-e,B-1>>)
* Add a user report to show CT Eval recommendations (<<issue-f,B-2>>)

[[issue-a]]
=== Insert clinical information string in CT Eval form

**Unnumbered Issue A-1a (high priority):** Clinical information field on the CT
Eval form to be auto-filled based on responses to questions in the background
form format to be:

* ††Age xx; [Asymptomatic for lung cancer]; Current Smoker; xx Pack Years††

or

* ††Age xx; [Asymptomatic for lung cancer]; Former Smoker; xx Pack Years; Quit
  xx years ago††

**Solution:** Developed clinical information string from background form and
inserted into new CT Eval form.

**Reported:** 2024-07-11 by iELCAP team.

[[issue-b]]
=== Provide support for user-controlled MRN and Study ID

**Unnumbered Issues A-2 and A-3 (high priority):** iELCAP uses the Epic MRN and
Study ID instead of Social Security Number to identify patients. {appname}
needs to support the use of these patient IDs in the correct places.

**Solutions:** Support the entering of the MRN on the registration page, allow
the modification of the MRN on the Intake form, allow the entering and changing
of the StudyID on the intake form, support displaying of the MRN and Study ID
(if assigned) on the page header.

**Reported:** 2024-07-11 by iELCAP team.

[[issue-c]]
=== Login: Implement single sign-on

**Issue 21-218:** When using single sign-on, user should not be prompted to log
in to VAPALS-ELCAP separately.  However, user must be matched to single sign-on
SECID.

**Solution:** Require user to sign in once using Access and Verify created by
system administrator. This allows SECID to be captured and tied to user.  For
this testing version, where we don't yet have access to SECID, the IP address
is used instead. Note: for testing, if user does not have a stable IP address,
they will be required to sign in with Access and Verify to update the IP
address.

**Reported:** 2021-03 by Lilly.

[[issue-d]]
=== Logout: Upon sign-out, redirect to the correct web page

**Issue 21-221:** Currently users are being directed to the home page of the
clinical site they just logged out of.

**Solution:** User is redirected to correct logout page.

**Reported:** 2022-04 by Jirapatnakul.

[[issue-e]]
=== Include name and last5 in every csv file on every row

**Unnumbered issue B-1:** A report is available to be run by the sysadmin that
outputs all patient data for statistical analysis. Lines did not include
patient ID.

**Solution:** Add `saminame` (full patient name) and `last5` (First letter of
last name and last four digits of SSN) in each line of report.

**Reported:** 2022-12-09 by Henschke and Yip.

[[issue-f]]
=== Add a user report to show CT Eval recommendations

**Unnumbered issue B-2:** Develop a new user report that shows recommendations
from completed CT Evaluations. Allow sorting by type of recommendation and put
totals at top of columns.

**Solution:** Added report.

**Reported:** 2022-12-09 by Henschke and Avila.

[[prepare]]
== Prepare for installation

This involves creating a directory to work in, running a script to back up
certain datafiles and web-application files, and then going through steps to
back up M routines that will be replaced by the patch.

[[be-osehra]]
=== Assume the identity of your +osehra+ Unix user

This step assumes you use a `dzdo` or `sudo` command to do this; here, the
symbol `$DEMAND` will stand for whichever command you use. (Also, in all the
command-line examples below, `$` simply means your command-line prompt.) If
your configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
configuration:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ $DEMAND su - osehra
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[prep-installdir]]
=== Prepare install directory

If this is your first time installling this, execute the following commands.
They create a shell variable, and then create the work directory and sets it
as your current directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-17/
$ mkdir -p $INDIR
$ cd $INDIR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've already tried installing this before, you can use the following
commands instead:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-17/
$ cd $INDIR
$ rm -rf ./sami*.{txt,kid} ./auxfiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[prep-archive]]
=== Download and prepare the archive file

You may safely download the archive file
(link:sami-{version}.zip[++sami-{version}.zip++]) in advance of the actual
install.

include::.dtool/curl-snippet.adoi[]

Then unzip the archive file with the following command.

include::.dtool/unzip-snippet.adoi[]

[[install-www]]
=== Install web-application files

At this point, the web-application files must be installed. This is done with a
script that backs up the affected directories before installing anything, then
upgrades the web-application files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./upgrade-auxfiles
Backing up files to ./.aux-backup:
[... lists of files backed up ...]
Compressing the backup:
[... list of files being compressed ...]
Cleaning up.
Done with backup of auxiliary files.

Updating from ./auxfiles
[... list of files being updated ...]
Done with install.

You may now proceed with the KIDS installation.
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outside the VA firewall, {appname} systems maintain up-to-date clones of the
official GitHub repository, and this script will have different output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./upgrade-auxfiles
Backing up files to ./.aux-backup
[... lists of files backed up ...]
Compressing the backup:
[... list of files being compressed ...]
Cleaning up.
Done with backup of auxiliary files.

Found a valid Git repository; pulling updates ...
[... output varies ...]
Done with install.
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// eval::[Section.setlevel(2)]

[[backup-m]]
=== Back up M routines

Before the installation, we also need to back up existing {appname} routines
that will be overwritten by this install. To do this, you will have to start a
Caché or YottaDB session (depending on your particular installation), sign in
to Vista, and then call the direct-mode interface `^%RO` (“routine out”).

We have made efforts to display accurate instructions, but there are likely to
be minor differences between implementations. Be sure to follow the correct
dialog for your implementation.

[[enter-m]]
==== Enter M

At the Unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using the
`csession` command on Caché or the `mumps` command on YottaDB/GT.M:

[[enter-m-cache]]
††**On Caché**††

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ csession vapals

Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS

>_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[enter-m-yotta]]
††**On YottaDB/GT.M**††

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mumps -dir

>_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[signin]]
==== Sign into Vista

At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your access code,
and then just press return at the [ttsp nowrap]##OPTION NAME## prompt to return
to direct mode. This sets up your authentication variables. Here's a sample
capture of this step:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>do ^XUP

Setting up programmer environment
This is a TEST account.

Access Code: *******
Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

Select OPTION NAME:
>_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[routine-list]]
==== List of routines

The routine names to save are listed below; you may copy the list and paste it
at the appropriate `Routine` prompt. At the final `Routine` prompt, press
return to indicate the list of routines is done.

include::.dtool/routine-list.adoi[]

[[run-ro]]
==== Run the backup

Creating the routine backup file differs by implementation.

[[backup-cache]]
††**On Caché**††

Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a warning message
(specifically, the routine name will have `[???]` after it, and the line
[ttsp]##[does not exist]## after that). These messages can be safely
disregarded.

In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also provide a
+Description+ and press return at the +Parameters+ and [ttsp]##Printer Format##
prompts to accept the defaults of +WNS+ and +No+, respectively:

include::.dtool/cache-ro-snippet.adoi[]

[[backup-yotta]]
††**On YottaDB/GT.M**††

Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the routine name
not appearing under the input line, and won't count towards the number of
routines. These can be safely disregarded.

In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also provide a
[ttsp]##Header Label## and press return at the [ttsp]##Strip comments## prompt
to accept the default of +no+:

include::.dtool/yotta-ro-snippet.adoi[]

eval::[Section.setlevel(2)]

You'll remain in the M environment for the next section.

[[install]]
== Main install instructions

This consists of loading and installing the KIDS package, and activating the
new web-application files.

[[install-kids]]
=== Installing the KIDS package

This installs the various M assets required by the application.

[[signin-kids]]
==== Enter the KIDS Installation menu

At the [ttsp]##OPTION NAME## prompt select [ttsp]##XPD MAIN## to enter the
[ttsp]##Kernel Installation & Distribution System## main menu, and at the
[ttsp]##Select \... Option## prompt select +Installation+:

include::.dtool/enter-kids-snippet.adoi[]

[[load-pkg]]
==== Load KIDS package

Select option 1 and press return at the +Continue+ prompt.

include::.dtool/load-kids-snippet.adoi[]

[[install-pkg]]
==== Install KIDS package

Select option 6, enter the space bar at the [ttsp]##INSTALL NAME## prompt, and
press return at the next three prompts. Note that `[now]` denotes the current
time when you're doing the install.

include::.dtool/install-kids-snippet.adoi[]

eval::[Section.setlevel(2)]

You now have {appname} {version} (††{va-version}††) installed in your M
environment. The install is now complete. You may leave the M environment by
typing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>halt
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend running tests of your {appname} application to confirm the
environment is operational and bug-free, before notifying users that {appname}
is ready for their use.

[[backout]]
== Optional backout instructions

Should errors or other problems result from installing this package, contact
the {appname} development team for package-backout instructions.

[[routines]]
== Routines

Line 2 of each of these routines now look like:

include::.dtool/routine-lines2.adoi[]

The checksums below are Vista Type B checksums ([ttsp]##do CHECK1^XTSUMBLD##).

include::.dtool/checksums.adoi[]
