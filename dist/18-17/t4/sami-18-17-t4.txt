1. Description

 SAMI 18-17-t4 adds one high-priority update to add a user report to show
 CT Eval recommendations.

 The definitive source for the VAPALS-ELCAP application - codebase,
 package distributions (including this one), and documentation - is at
 the following public Github repository:

 https://github.com/VA-PALS-ELCAP/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/

 The most up-to-date and accurate version of this file can be found at

 https://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/18-17/t4/

 These instructions are for your Vista environment’s sysadmin. As
 usual, please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it
 to your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.

 The changes in this patch are:


 1.1. Add a user report to show CT Eval recommendations

   unnumbered issue (high priority): Develop a new user report that
   shows recommendations from completed CT Evaluations. Allow sorting by
   type of recommendation and put totals at top of columns.

   solution: Added report.

   reported: 2022-12-09 by Henschke and Avila.

3. Prepare for installation

 This involves creating a directory to work in, running a script to
 back up certain datafiles and web-application files, and then going
 through steps to back up M routines that will be replaced by the
 patch.


 3.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user

   This step assumes you type a dzdo or sudo to do this; here the
   symbol $DEMAND will stand for whichever command you use. (Also, in
   all the command-line examples below, '$' simply means your
   command-line prompt.) If your configuration is different, please
   adjust this step to match your configuration:

    $ $DEMAND su - osehra
    $


 3.2. Prepare install directory

   If this is your first time installling this, execute the following
   commands.  They create a shell variable, and then creates the work
   directory and sets it as your current directory.

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-17/t4
    $ mkdir -p $INDIR
    $ cd $INDIR

   If you've already tried installing this once, you can use the
   following commands instead:

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-17/t4
    $ cd $INDIR
    $ rm -rf ./sami*.{txt,kid} ./auxfiles


 3.3. Download and prepare the archive file

   You may safely download the archive file sami-18-17-t4.zip in
   advance of the actual install. In the following text, "[now]"
   represents a time stamp representing your current time, and
   "[bits/sec]" is a data rate and "[time]" is how long the file took
   to transfer (both of which vary based on the user's network
   conditions).

     $ wget --no-verbose 'https://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/18-17/t4/sami-18-17-t4.zip'
     [now] URL:https://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/18-17/t4/sami-18-17-t4.zip [size/size] -> "sami-18-17-t4.zip" [1]
     $ _

   Then unzip the archive file with the following command.

     $ unzip sami-18-17-t4.zip
     Archive:  sami-18-17-t4.zip
       ...
     $ _


 3.4. Install web-application files

    At this point, the web-application files must be installed. This
    is done with a script that backs up the affected directories
    before installing anything, then upgrades the web-application
    files.

     $ ./upgrade-auxfiles
     Backing up files to ./.aux-backup:
     [... lists of files backed up ...]
     Compressing the backup:
     [... lists of files being compressed ...]
     Cleaning up.
     Done with backup of auxiliary files.

     Updating from ./auxfiles ...
     [... lists of files being updated ...]
     Done with install.

     You may now proceed with the KIDS installation.
     $ _

    Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date
    clones of the official GitHub repository, and this script will
    have different output.

     $ ./upgrade-auxfiles
     Backing up files to ./.aux-backup:
     [... lists of files backed up ...]
     Compressing the backup:
     [... lists of files being compressed ...]
     Cleaning up.
     Done with backup of auxiliary files.

     Found a valid Git repository; pulling updates ...
     [... output varies ...]
     Done with install.
     $ _


 3.5. Back up M routines

   Before the installation, we also need to back up existing
   VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten by this install. To
   do this, you will have to start a Cache or YottaDB session
   (depending on your particular installation), sign in to Vista, and
   then call the direct-mode interface ^%RO ("routine out").

   We have made efforts to display accurate instructions, but there
   are likely to be minor differences between implementations. Be sure
   to follow the correct dialog for your implementation.


  3.5.1. Enter M

    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the 'csession' command on Cache or the 'mumps' command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:

    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals

    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS

    >_


    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir

    >_


  3.5.2. Sign into Vista

    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:

    > do ^XUP

    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.

    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

    Select OPTION NAME:
    >_


  3.5.3. List of routines

    The routine names to save are listed below; you may copy the list
    and paste it at the appropriate Routine prompt. At the final
    Routine prompt, press return to indicate the list of routines is
    done.

SAMIPAT
SAMIUR
SAMIUR2
SAMIURUL


  3.5.4. Run the backup

    Creating the routine backup file differs by implementation.

    On Caché
    --------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a
    warning message (specifically, the routine name will have '[???]'
    after it, and the line [does not exist] after it). These messages
    can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
    respectively:

     >do ^%RO

     Routine output (please use %ROMF for object code output)
     Routine(s): SAMIPAT
     Routine(s): SAMIUR
     Routine(s): SAMIUR2
     Routine(s): SAMIURUL
     Routine(s):

     Description: SAMI*18.0*17 SEQ #17 T4 routine backup

     Output routines to
     Device: /home/osehra/run/in/sami/18-17/t4/sami-18-17-t4-back.ro
     Parameters? ("WNS") =>
     Printer Format? No => No
     SAMIPAT.INT     SAMIUR.INT      SAMIUR2.INT     SAMIURUL.INT
     >_

    On YottaDB/GT.M
    ---------------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the
    routine name not appearing under the input line, and won't count
    towards the number of routines. These can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Header Label and press return at the Strip comments
    prompt to accept the default of No:

     >do ^%RO

     Routine Output - Save selected routines into RO file.

     Routines: SAMIPAT
     SAMIPAT
     Current total of 1 routines.

     Routines: SAMIUR
     SAMIUR
     Current total of 2 routines.

     Routines: SAMIUR2
     SAMIUR2
     Current total of 3 routines.

     Routines: SAMIURUL
     SAMIURUL
     Current total of 4 routines.

     Routine:

     Output device <terminal>: /home/osehra/run/in/sami/18-17/t4/sami-18-17-t4-back.ro

    You'll remain in the M environment for the next section.
