== Description

{nmsp} {version} adds one medium-priority update to improve CT evaluation
reports.

The definitive source for the {appname} application---codebase, package
distributions (including this one), and documentation---is a
https://github.com/ParaxialTechnologies/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/[public GitHub
repository].

These instructions are for your Vista environment's sysadmin. As usual, please
capture the complete dialog of your install and send it to your {appname}
support team.

The changes in this patch are:

[options="compact"]
* Improve or fix items in the CT Evaluation Report
  (link:#issue-a[request{nbsp}1], medium{nbsp}priority)
* Install a routine that allows the movement of patients to another site
  (link:#issue-b[change{nbsp}1], medium priority)

[[issue-a]]
=== Improve or fix items in the CT Evaluation Report

**Request 1 (medium priority):** Various changes to the CT Evaluation Report
have been requested by the iELCAP team and the Mount Sinai radiologists:

[options="compact"]
. Annual repeat CT: When the radiologists selects ††Annual repeat†† as the LDCT
  follow-up, the report says ††A followup CT scan is
  recommended{nbsp}...††. This should be changed t ††An annual repeat CT scan
  is recommended{nbsp}...††.
. Follow-up recommendation is missing a dash in “followup CT.”
. The heading ††**Breast**†† is missing in the report: A situation arose where
  nothing was selected for the breast, but a comment was entered. The comment
  shows up, but there’s no heading for the Breast section, so it’s sort of a
  dangling sentence.
. CAC score: If the CAC score is 0 (that is, the radiologist selects ††None††
  for all), the report doesn’t say anything about CAC.  If the CAC score
  is{nbsp}0, it should say: ††Coronary Artery Calcifications: None. The Visual
  Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Score is 0.††
. Ensure generator isn't adding periods after comment blocks.
. Add text if ††insufficient information for sign off†† checkbox is checked.
. Swap order of emphysema finding and CAC score.
. The wrong study ID was on the CT Eval report. 
. Aortic valve calcification: Similar to CAC score as above---if it’s None,
  it should explicitly say None.
   
**Solution:** These changes and fixes have been made.

**Reported:** 2024-07-11 by iELCAP team, 2024-09-16 by Mt. Sinai radiologists.

[[issue-b]]
=== Use StudyID throughout the application

**Change 1:** Allow patient movement to another site in the same network or the
movement of an accidental duplicate patient record to a faux site. This is
actually from an earlier patch that was not taken up by the field.

**Solution:** Include `SAMIMOV` in release.

**Completed:** 2024-09-20 by F. Marshall.

[[prepare]]
== Prepare for installation

This involves creating a directory to work in, running a script to back up
certain datafiles and web-application files, and then going through steps to
back up M routines that will be replaced by the patch.

[[be-osehra]]
=== Assume the identity of your +osehra+ Unix user

This step assumes you use a `dzdo` or `sudo` command to do this; here, the
symbol `$DEMAND` will stand for whichever command you use. (Also, in all the
command-line examples below, `$` simply means your command-line prompt.) If
your configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
configuration:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ $DEMAND su - osehra
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[prep-installdir]]
=== Prepare install directory

If this is your first time installing this, execute the following commands.
They create a shell variable, and then create the work directory and sets it as
your current directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-19/b1
$ mkdir -p $INDIR
$ cd $INDIR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you've already tried installing this before, you can use the following
commands instead:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18-19/b1
$ cd $INDIR
$ rm -rf ./sami*.{txt,kid} ./auxfiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[prep-archive]]
=== Download and prepare the archive file

You may safely download the archive file
(link:sami-{version}.zip[++sami-{version}.zip++]) in advance of the actual
install.

include::.dtool/curl-snippet.adoi[]

Then unzip the archive file with the following command.

include::.dtool/unzip-snippet.adoi[]

[[install-www]]
=== Install web-application files

At this point, the web-application files must be installed. This is done with a
script that backs up the affected directories before installing anything, then
upgrades the web-application files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./upgrade-auxfiles
Backing up files to ./.aux-backup:
[... lists of files backed up ...]
Compressing the backup:
[... list of files being compressed ...]
Cleaning up.
Done with backup of auxiliary files.

Updating from ./auxfiles
[... list of files being updated ...]
Done with install.

You may now proceed with the KIDS installation.
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outside the VA firewall, {appname} systems maintain up-to-date clones of the
official GitHub repository, and this script will have different output.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ ./upgrade-auxfiles
Backing up files to ./.aux-backup
[... lists of files backed up ...]
Compressing the backup:
[... list of files being compressed ...]
Cleaning up.
Done with backup of auxiliary files.

Found a valid Git repository; pulling updates ...
[... output varies ...]
Done with install.
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// eval::[Section.setlevel(2)]

[[backup-m]]
=== Back up M routines

Before the installation, we also need to back up existing {appname} routines
that will be overwritten by this install. To do this, you will have to start a
Caché or YottaDB session (depending on your particular installation), sign in
to Vista, and then call the direct-mode interface `^%RO` (“routine out”).

We have made efforts to display accurate instructions, but there are likely to
be minor differences between implementations. Be sure to follow the correct
dialog for your implementation.

[[enter-m]]
==== Enter M

At the Unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using the
`csession` command on Caché or the `mumps` command on YottaDB/GT.M:

[[enter-m-cache]]
††**On Caché**††

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ csession vapals

Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS

>_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[enter-m-yotta]]
††**On YottaDB/GT.M**††

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ mumps -dir

>_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[signin]]
==== Sign into Vista

At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your access code,
and then just press return at the [ttsp nowrap]##OPTION NAME## prompt to return
to direct mode. This sets up your authentication variables. Here's a sample
capture of this step:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>do ^XUP

Setting up programmer environment
This is a TEST account.

Access Code: *******
Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

Select OPTION NAME:
>_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[routine-list]]
==== List of routines

The routine names to save are listed below; you may copy the list and paste it
at the appropriate `Routine` prompt. At the final `Routine` prompt, press
return to indicate the list of routines is done.

include::.dtool/routine-list.adoi[]

[[run-ro]]
==== Run the backup

Creating the routine backup file differs by implementation.

[[backup-cache]]
††**On Caché**††

Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a warning message
(specifically, the routine name will have `[???]` after it, and the line
[ttsp]##[does not exist]## after that). These messages can be safely
disregarded.

In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also provide a
+Description+ and press return at the +Parameters+ and [ttsp]##Printer Format##
prompts to accept the defaults of +WNS+ and +No+, respectively:

include::.dtool/cache-ro-snippet.adoi[]

[[backup-yotta]]
††**On YottaDB/GT.M**††

Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the routine name
not appearing under the input line, and won't count towards the number of
routines. These can be safely disregarded.

In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also provide a
[ttsp]##Header Label## and press return at the [ttsp]##Strip comments## prompt
to accept the default of +no+:

include::.dtool/yotta-ro-snippet.adoi[]

eval::[Section.setlevel(2)]

You'll remain in the M environment for the next section.

[[install]]
== Main install instructions

This consists of loading and installing the KIDS package, and activating the
new web-application files.

[[signin-kids]]
=== Enter the KIDS Installation menu

At the [ttsp]##OPTION NAME## prompt select [ttsp]##XPD MAIN## to enter the
[ttsp]##Kernel Installation & Distribution System## main menu, and at the
[ttsp]##Select \... Option## prompt select +Installation+:

include::.dtool/enter-kids-snippet.adoi[]

[[load-pkg]]
=== Load KIDS package

Select option 1 and press return at the +Continue+ prompt.

include::.dtool/load-kids-snippet.adoi[]

[[verify-checksums]]
=== Verify checksums (_NEW_)

Run the [ttsp]##Verify Checksums in the Transport Global## option. This option
will let you ensure the integrity of this update in two ways.

First, it will compare the routines you already have in your habitat to what
this update was developed to replace, and if they don't match it will warn
you. If you receive such a warning, do not proceed with the installation until
you understand why your Before checksums don't match and have confirmed with
the {appname} development team that it's safe to proceed. Otherwise, you may
corrupt the {appname} application, which may break certain features or even
endanger patient health or privacy.

Second, it will compare the routines that have been loaded from the KIDS file
to what the developers distributed, to be sure the KIDS file was not corrupted
in transit. If it was, this option will warn you that one or more After
checksums don't match. In such cases, reach out to the {appname} development
team to get a clean copy of the release.

Once you're in [ttsp]##Verify Checksums in the Transport Global##, select
option{nbsp}2, press the space bar, and then press the Enter key to select the
install name.
    
Hit the Enter key for [ttsp]##Want each Routine Listed with Checksums: Yes//##.

At the [ttsp]##DEVICE: HOME//## prompt, type [ttsp]##;C-SCROLL## to display the
entire report.

You'll get a report showing if the Before checksums are different than what was
expected. If that happens, discontinue the install until you have worked with
your {appname} development team.

If the report shows that After checksums are not as expected, your file may be
corrupted. This would be unusual, and once again, you should contact your
{appname} development Team before continuing with the install.


[[install-pkg]]
=== Install KIDS package

Select option 6, enter the space bar at the [ttsp]##INSTALL NAME## prompt, and
press return at the next three prompts. Note that `[now]` denotes the current
time when you're doing the install.

include::.dtool/install-kids-snippet.adoi[]

// [[dicom]]
// ==== Optional DICOM step

// If you have a DICOM server that you want to integrate with {appname}, use
// `^` and then enter to get back out to the programmer prompt, then use the
// following command:

// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// >DO MKSVC^SAMIDMC1
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// This will create four new entries in the Web Service URL handler file to
// register new web services.

// Sites without a DICOM server, or sites that have a DICOM server they do not
// want to integrate with ScreeningPlus, should not run this optional step.

eval::[Section.setlevel(2)]

You now have {appname} {version} (††{va-version}††) installed in your M
environment. The install is now complete. You may leave the M environment by
typing

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>halt
$ _
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We recommend running tests of your {appname} application to confirm the
environment is operational and bug-free, before notifying users that {appname}
is ready for their use.

[[backout]]
== Optional backout instructions

Should errors or other problems result from installing this package, contact
the {appname} development team for package-backout instructions.

[[routines]]
== Routines

Line 2 of each of these routines now look like:

include::.dtool/routine-lines2.adoi[]

The checksums below are Vista Type B checksums ([ttsp]##do CHECK1^XTSUMBLD##).

include::.dtool/checksums.adoi[]
