#. Description

 #{nmsp} #{version} improvements to the CT Evaluation report.

 The definitive source for the #{appname} application - codebase,
 package distributions (including this one), and documentation - is at
 the following public Github repository:

 https://github.com/ParaxialTechnologies/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP

 The most up-to-date and accurate version of this file can be found at

 https://vistaexpertise.net/#{appdir}/dist/#{partialdir}/

 These instructions are for your Vista environment’s sysadmin. As
 usual, please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it
 to your #{appname} support team.

 The changes in this release are:

 #.#. Improve or fix items in the CT Evaluation Report.

   Request (medium priority): Various changes to the CT Evaluation Report
   have been requested by the iELCAP team and the Mount Sinai radiologists:
   1. Ensure generator isn't adding periods after comment blocks.
   2. Add text if "insufficient information for sign off" checkbox is checked.
   3. Swap order of emphysema finding and CAC score
   4. Follow-up recommendation seems to say "followup CT" - follow-up has a 
    dash. 
   5. Annual repeat CT – when the radiologists selects ‘Annual repeat' as the 
    LDCT follow-up, the report says “A followup CT scan is recommended…”. This 
    should be something like “An annual repeat CT scan is recommended…”.
   6. Heading “Breast” is missing in the report – we had a situation where 
    nothing was selected for the breast, but a comment was entered. The comment 
    shows up, but there’s no heading for the Breast section, so it’s sort of a 
    dangling sentence.
   7. CAC score – if the CAC score is 0 (that is, the radiologist selects None 
    for all), the report doesn’t say anything about CAC.  If it is 0, it should 
    say: “Coronary Artery Calcifications: None. The Visual Coronary Artery 
    Calcium (CAC) Score is 0.”
   8. Aortic valve calcification – similar issue as above, if it’s None it 
    should explicitly say None.
   
   solution: These changes have been made.

   reported: 2024-07-11 by iELCAP team, 2024-09-16 by Mt. Sinai radiologists.

 #.#. Install a routine that allows the movement of patients to another site.
 
   request: Allow patient movement to another site in the same network or the 
   movement of an accidentally duplicate patient record to a faux site. This 
   is actually from an earlier patch that was not taken up by the field.
   
   solution: Include SAMIMOV in release.

#. Package elements

#>include: .dtool/packelements.txt

// File                     Number  Change
// -----------------------  ------  ---------------


#. Prepare for installation

 This involves creating a directory to work in, running a script to
 back up certain datafiles and web-application files, and then going
 through steps to back up M routines that will be replaced by the
 patch.


 #.#. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user

   This step assumes you type a dzdo or sudo to do this; here the
   symbol $DEMAND will stand for whichever command you use. (Also, in
   all the command-line examples below, '$' simply means your
   command-line prompt.) If your configuration is different, please
   adjust this step to match your configuration:

    $ $DEMAND su - osehra
    $


 #.#. Prepare install directory

   If this is your first time installling this, execute the following
   commands.  They create a shell variable, and then create the work
   directory and sets it as your current directory.

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/#{lnmsp}/#{partialdir}
    $ mkdir -p $INDIR
    $ cd $INDIR

   If you've already tried installing this once, you can use the
   following commands instead:

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/#{lnmsp}/#{partialdir}
    $ cd $INDIR
    $ rm -rf ./sami*.{txt,kid} ./auxfiles


 #.#. Download and prepare the archive file

   You may safely download the archive file sami-#{version}.zip in
   advance of the actual install. In the following text, "[now]"
   represents a time stamp representing your current time, and
   "[bits/sec]" is a data rate and "[time]" is how long the file took
   to transfer (both of which vary based on the user's network
   conditions).

#>include: .dtool/wget-snippet.txt

   Then unzip the archive file with the following command.

#>include: .dtool/unzip-snippet.txt


 #.#. Install web-application files

    At this point, the web-application files must be installed. This
    is done with a script that backs up the affected directories
    before installing anything, then upgrades the web-application
    files.

     $ ./upgrade-auxfiles
     Backing up files to ./.aux-backup:
     [... lists of files backed up ...]
     Compressing the backup:
     [... lists of files being compressed ...]
     Cleaning up.
     Done with backup of auxiliary files.

     Updating from ./auxfiles ...
     [... lists of files being updated ...]
     Done with install.

     You may now proceed with the KIDS installation.
     $ _

    Outside the VA firewall, #{appname} systems maintain up-to-date
    clones of the official GitHub repository, and this script will
    have different output.

     $ ./upgrade-auxfiles
     Backing up files to ./.aux-backup:
     [... lists of files backed up ...]
     Compressing the backup:
     [... lists of files being compressed ...]
     Cleaning up.
     Done with backup of auxiliary files.

     Found a valid Git repository; pulling updates ...
     [... output varies ...]
     Done with install.
     $ _


 #.#. Back up M routines

   Before the installation, we also need to back up existing
   #{appname} routines that will be overwritten by this install. To
   do this, you will have to start a Cache or YottaDB session
   (depending on your particular installation), sign in to Vista, and
   then call the direct-mode interface ^%RO ("routine out").

   We have made efforts to display accurate instructions, but there
   are likely to be minor differences between implementations. Be sure
   to follow the correct dialog for your implementation.


  #.#.#. Enter M

    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the 'csession' command on Cache or the 'mumps' command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:

    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals

    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS

    >_


    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir

    >_


  #.#.#. Sign into Vista

    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:

    > do ^XUP

    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.

    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

    Select OPTION NAME:
    >_


  #.#.#. List of routines

    The routine names to save are listed below; you may copy the list
    and paste it at the appropriate Routine prompt. At the final
    Routine prompt, press return to indicate the list of routines is
    done.

#>include: .dtool/routine-list.txt


  #.#.#. Run the backup

    Creating the routine backup file differs by implementation.

    On Caché
    --------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a
    warning message (specifically, the routine name will have '[???]'
    after it, and the line [does not exist] after it). These messages
    can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
    respectively:

#>include: .dtool/cache-ro-snippet.txt

    On YottaDB/GT.M
    ---------------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the
    routine name not appearing under the input line, and won't count
    towards the number of routines. These can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Header Label and press return at the Strip comments
    prompt to accept the default of No:

#>include: .dtool/yotta-ro-snippet.txt

    You'll remain in the M environment for the next section.


#. Main install instructions

 This consists of loading and installing the KIDS package, and
 activating the new web-application files.


  #.#. Enter the KIDS Installation menu

    At the OPTION NAME prompt, select XPD MAIN to enter the Kernel
    Installation & Distribution System main menu, and at the Select
    ... Option prompt, select Installation:

#>include: .dtool/enter-kids-snippet.txt


  #.#. Load KIDS package

    Select option 1 and press return at the Continue prompt.

#>include: .dtool/load-kids-snippet.txt


  #.#. Install KIDS package

    Select option 6, enter the space bar at the INSTALL NAME prompt,
    and press return at the next three prompts. Note that '[now]'
    denotes the current time when you're doing the install.

#>include: .dtool/install-kids-snippet.txt

   You now have #{appname} #{version} (#{vista-version}) installed in
   your M environment. The install is now complete, and you may leave
   the M environment by typing

   > halt
   $ _

   We recommend running tests of your #{appname} app to confirm the
   environment is operational and bug-free, before notifying users
   that #{appname} is ready for their use.


#. Optional backout instructions

 Should errors or other problems result from installing this package
 contact the #{appname} development team for package-backout
 instructions.


#. Routines

 Line 2 of each of these routines now look like:
#>include: .dtool/routine-lines2.txt

 The checksums below are Vista Type B checksums (do CHECK1^XTSUMBLD).

#>include: .dtool/checksums.txt
