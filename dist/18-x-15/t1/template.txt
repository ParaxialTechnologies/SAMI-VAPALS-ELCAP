#. Description

 #{nmsp} #{version} adds 12 updates, most of them changes to the CT Eval form
 and the CT Report.  The definitive source for the VAPALS-ELCAP application -
 codebase, package distributions (including this one), and
 documentation - is at the following public Github repository:

 https://github.com/VA-PALS-ELCAP/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/

 The most up-to-date and accurate version of this file can be found at

 https://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/#{partialdir}/

 These instructions are for your Vista environment’s sysadmin. As
 usual, please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it
 to your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.

 The 5 high priority, 5 medium priority, and 2 low priority changes made or
 bugs fixed are:


#.#. CT Evaluation Form: Make lymph node map a little bigger

      issue 21-149 (medium priority): Make the lymph node map in the Neck and
      Mediastinal section bigger if possible.

      solution: Increase the size of the lymph node map.

      reported: 2021-07-25 by Chenoweth.


#.#. CT Evaluation Form: Keep previous information for nodules listed as "Not
      included in scan" and "Not in outside report"

      issue 21-128 (medium priority): Current behavior of these two nodule
      status options is to blank out fields in the nodule table; desired
      behavior is to keep the information (as maybe later scans will have the
      nodules). This partially reverts an earlier request. The fields should
      only be grayed out for Prev seen, resolved or Prev seen, not a nodule,
      not for other choices.

      solution: Changed to desired behavior.

      reported: 2021-07-13 by Yip.


#.#. CT Evaluation Form: If "Is it new" is set to Prev seen resolved, set
      nodule status to Resolved

      issue 21-129 (medium priority): Automatically set the nodule status to
      resolved if the "is it new?" option is set to Prev seen, resolved.

      solution: Changed to desired behavior.

      reported: 2021-07-13 by Yip.


#.#. CT Evaluation Form: If CT Eval is a baseline, suppress comparative scans
      and prior scans in report.

      issue 21-167 (medium priority): Automatically set the nodule status to
      resolved if the "is it new?" option is set to Prev seen, resolved.

      solution: Changed to desired behavior.

      reported: 2021-09-02 by Phoenix Team.


#.#. CT Evaluation Form and CT Report: Add right and left for lymph nodes
      N10-N14.

      issue 21-170 (high priority): In the Neck and Mediastinal section on the
      form add right and left for lymph nodes N10-N14. Extend CT Report to
      handle new form fields.

      solution: Added form-fields and checkboxes.

      reported: 2021-09-07 by Henschke


#.#. CT Report: The lymph node station does not carry over to the CT Report.

      issue 21-170 (high priority): Lymph node stations are reported in the
      Neck and Mediastinal section on the form but that information is not
      included in the CT Report.

      solution: Add lymph node stations to CT Report.

      reported: 2021-07-25 by Chenoweth.


#.#. CT Report: There is an extra space in front of Description

      issue 21-150 (low priority): There is an extra space in front of
      Description at the top of the CT Report.

      solution: Removed extra space.

      reported: 2021-07-25 by Chenoweth.


#.#. CT Report: Pleural effusion text revision in CT report

      issue 21-135 (medium priority): Current text reads "on right pleural
      effusion and on left pleural effusion", should be "pleural effusion on
      right and pleural effusion on left"

      solution: Correct CT Report translation.

      reported: 2021-08-03 by Slaughter.


#.#. CT Report: In Impression section please remove the word "above"

      issue 21-176 (low priority):

      solution: Remove word from CT Report. Must run INIT2GPH^SAMICTD2 to get
      the fix which will be in the Post-install. No extra action required by
      system administrator.

      reported: 2021-09-16 by Murphy.


#.#. CT Report: Change wording for when nothing is put in CAC or emphysema.

      issue 21-192 (high priority): In Emphysema and Coronary Artery
      Calcification, if nothing is entered, then in the report, indicate
      "Emphysema score not provided" and "Coronary Artery Calcification score
      not provided."

      solution: Changed report translation.

      reported: 2021-10-11 by Henschke.


#.#. Intake but no CT Report: Include patients who had CTs before enrollment
     but none since enrollment

      issue 21-160 (high priority): To make sure all participants have a CT
      Scan in the program those who had CT Scans before enrollment need to be
      on this report.

      solution: Add active patients who have not had a CT Scan since
      enrollment.

      reported: 2021-08-23 by Henschke.


 #.#. Infrastructure: Improve support for parameterization by system and site.

      issue 21-194 (high priority): Some sites or organizations will need
      different wording or other differences from the default. (For example,
      ELCAP protocols vs Lung-Rads.)

      solution: Developed new parameters to customize VAPALS.

#. Package elements

#>include: .dtool/packelements.txt


#. Prepare for installation

 This involves creating a directory to work in, running a script to
 back up certain datafiles and web-application files, and then going
 through steps to back up M routines that will be replaced by the
 patch.


 #.#. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user

   This step assumes you type a dzdo or sudo to do this; here the
   symbol $DEMAND will stand for whichever command you use. (Also, in
   all the command-line examples below, '$' simply means your
   command-line prompt.) If your configuration is different, please
   adjust this step to match your configuration:

    $ $DEMAND su - osehra
    $


 #.#. Prepare install directory

   If this is your first time installling this, execute the following
   commands.  They create a shell variable, and then creates the work
   directory and sets it as your current directory.

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/#{lnmsp}/#{partialdir}
    $ mkdir -p $INDIR
    $ cd $INDIR

   If you've already tried installing this once, you can use the
   following commands instead:

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/#{lnmsp}/#{partialdir}
    $ cd $INDIR
    $ rm -rf ./sami*.{txt,kid} ./*webapp*


 #.#. Download and prepare the archive file

   You may safely download the archive file sami-#{version}.zip in advance
   of the actual install. In the following text, "[now]" represents a
   time stamp representing your current time, and "[bits/sec]" is a
   data rate and "[time]" is how long the file took to transfer (both
   of which vary based on the user's network conditions).

#>include: .dtool/wget-snippet.txt

   Then unzip the archive file with the following command.

    $ unzip #{lnmsp}-#{version}.zip
    Archive:  #{lnmsp}-#{version}.zip
      [... list of files being extracted ...]
    $ _


 #.#. Install web-application files

    At this point, the web-application files must be installed. This is done
    with a script that backs up the affected directories before installing
    anything, then upgrades the web-application files.

     $ ./upgrade-webapp
     Backing up files to ./.webapp-backup:
     [... lists of files backed up ...]
     Compressing the backup:
     [... lists of files being compressed ...]
     Cleaning up.
     Done with backup of webapp files.

     Updating from ./webapp-upgrade-files ...
     [... lists of files being updated ...]
     Done with install.

     You may now proceed with the KIDS installation.
     $ _

    Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date clones of
    the official GitHub repository, and this script will have different output.

     $ ./upgrade-webapp
     Backing up files to ./.webapp-backup:
     [... lists of files backed up ...]
     Compressing the backup:
     [... lists of files being compressed ...]
     Cleaning up.
     Done with backup of webapp files.

     Found a valid Git repository; pulling updates ...
     [... output varies ...]
     Done with install.
     $ _


 #.#. Back up M routines

   Before the installation, we also need to back up existing
   VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten by this install. To
   do this, you will have to start a Cache or YottaDB session
   (depending on your particular installation), sign in to Vista, and
   then call the direct-mode interface ^%RO ("routine out").

   We have made efforts to display accurate instructions, but there
   are likely to be minor differences between implementations. Be sure
   to follow the correct dialog for your implementation.


  #.#.#. Enter M

    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the 'csession' command on Cache or the 'mumps' command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:

    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals

    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS

    >


    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir

    >


  #.#.#. Sign into Vista

    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:

    > do ^XUP

    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.

    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

    Select OPTION NAME:
    >


  #.#.#. List of routines

    The routine names to save are listed below; you may copy the list
    and paste it at the appropriate Routine prompt. At the final
    Routine prompt, press return to indicate the list of routines is
    done.

#>include: .dtool/routine-list.txt


  #.#.#. Run the backup

    Creating the routine backup file differs by implementation.

    On Caché
    --------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a
    warning message (specifically, the routine name will have '[???]'
    after it, and the line [does not exist] after it). These messages
    can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
    respectively:

#>include: .dtool/cache-ro-snippet.txt

    On YottaDB/GT.M
    ---------------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the
    routine name not appearing under the input line, and won't count
    towards the number of routines. These can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Header Label and press return at the Strip comments
    prompt to accept the default of No:

#>include: .dtool/yotta-ro-snippet.txt

    You'll remain in the M environment for the next section.

 This consists of loading and installing the KIDS package, and
 activating the new web-application files.
