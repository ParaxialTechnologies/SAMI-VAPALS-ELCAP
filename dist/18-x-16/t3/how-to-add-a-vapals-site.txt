   environment. Then, at the prompt in M, type "SET DUZ=1 DO Q^DI"

   the option will be completed for you:

    Select OPTION: ENTER OR EDIT FILE ENTRIES


    Input to what File: SAMI SITE// _

3. If the "Input to what file" prompt shows the value "SAMI SITE", you
   can hit enter; if not, type "SAMI SITE" and hit enter:

    Input to what File: SAMI SITE//           ([n] entries)

    EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//

    EDIT WHICH FIELD: ALL//

5. At the "SAMI SITE" prompt, type in the first few letters of a site
   name. For example, you can type in "ZZZTOG" and if your facility
   list is the same as ours, it will look like this:

    SAMI SITE: ZZZTOGUS STNB    ME  STNB  4029AF   INACTIVE

   Note that you must choose one of the items on the existing list of
   facilities. If you need to see the complete (and possibly long
   list), you can type "??" (as of this writing, a list of about 14
   sites will appear). You can choose to enter if you want to see more
   sites, or you can hit ^ if you are ready to exit the list and put
   in the first few letters of a site name. Note also that it doesn't
   really matter which one you select if you're on a test system.

6. You'll be prompted with something like this:

    Are you adding 'ZZZTOGUS STNB' as a new SAMI SITE (the [nth])? No//

   where "[nth]" is an ordinal number representing the number of SAMI
   sites that will exist if you add this one. Type "Y" and press
   enter.

o7. You will be given a series of prompts. SYMBOL will be a
   three-letter abbreviation for the test site (you will need to come
   up with an abbreviation). ACTIVE will by "Y" for Yes. DEFAULT
   PARAMETERS will be "VHA", and there is no additional configuration
   necessary for the "Select PARM" prompt, so you can hit enter.

    SYMBOL: TGS
    ACTIVE: Y  YES
    DEFAULT PARAMETERS: VHA
    Select PARM:


    Select SAMI SITE:

8. Hit enter at the "Select SAMI SITE" to get out, or add the
   beginning letters of a new facility to create another site.

9. When the "Select OPTION:" prompt reappears, hit enter.

10. Finally, when you get the M prompt again, type "H" and hit enter
    to exit M.
