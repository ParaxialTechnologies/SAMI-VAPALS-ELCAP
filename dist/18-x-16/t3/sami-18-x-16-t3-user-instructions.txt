Instructions for reviewing Intake Forms before submitting

1. The IT team and the medical expert team recommends that you review Intake
	Forms the first time you encounter the veteran after moving over to 
	VAPALS-ELCAP instead of trying to do them all at once.

2. Please do a quick review of the data that was entered. If you find an error, 
	please check the spreadsheet to see if it was correct on there. If it was
	correct on the spreadsheet but incorrect on the Intake Form, please let
	your VAPALS-ELCAP IT team know which field was incorrect, and as long as it
	isn't the name or MRN, let us know what the value was on the spreadsheet and 
	on the intake form. If it is, please describe what the difference was as
	specifically as possible.
	
3. Check these fields in particular. If there is not a selection, please fill
	it in. It is most likely to be a "No" but could have been missed
	in the process of entering data in the spreadsheet.
	    a. Eligible based on chart review?
	    b. Was a pre-enrollment discussion held?
	    c. Primary address verified?
	    
	
	
Questions for the Nurse Navigator team.
1. Will all patients in the spreadsheet be enrolled?
2. Do some/all/no patients have pre-enrollment discussions?
3. Do you track addresses? Do you verify addresses?
