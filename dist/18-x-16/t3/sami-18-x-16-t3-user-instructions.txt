Instructions to convert the patient data spreadsheet to VAPALS-ELCAP format.

NOTE: if there are issues, please contact your VAPALS-ELCAP dev team with as
much data as possible for instruction and fixes.

1. Make sure the site is configured. If you aren't sure, check with the system
administrator. If you are the sys admin and you don't know, see the 
instructions for configuring a new site {here/weburl/document title}

2. Try this process on a test server first to make sure it works as expected
before completing this process on the production server. There is a test
spreadsheet included with the install package for this function. It is named
intake-test-data-tab-del.txt and might be in the .home/osehra/run/in/sami/18-x-16/t3
directory. It can also be found as a download at {weburl}. If there are 
problems with the conversion, create a new test site to try again after changes
are made until the process runs smoothly. Then, make any changes that were
necessary on the test server on the production server as well before attempting
the conversion on production.

3. In Excel, export or save the patient spreadsheet as .tsv or tab-delimited
format. (Referred to hereafter as the .tsv file.)

4. Copy the .tsv file to the www directory that is in the top layer of the
osehra directory on the VAPALS-ELCAP server. (./home/osehra/www/)

5. Type "mumps -dir" at the Unix prompt to enter the M programmer's environment.

6. Type DO LOAD^SAMILD2 to start the conversion program.

7. Enter your three letter site code. (Nashville is TVH)
Example:
Select SAMI SITE: XXX  VISTA HEALTH CARE     XXX      6100

8. Hit enter to accept the default directory unless you had to put the .tsv
file somewhere else.
File Directory: /home/osehra/www/// 

9. After "Replace," enter three periods (...) to accept replacing the whole 
file name, after "With" enter the file you want to use. Hit enter after the 
second "Replace" to let it know that you don't want to replace anything else.
Example:
Enter filename to load.: LCSV2_DATA_2021-06-29_REDCAP.tsv
  Replace ... With intake-test-data-tab-del.txt  Replace 
   intake-test-data-tab-del.txt
   
Note: If you see an error warning something like this, there is a good chance 
you didn't put the data file in the right place: 
%YDB-E-SETECODE, Non-empty value assigned to $ECODE (user-defined error trap)

This example is similar to the beginning of the output you should see:
keyrow is 3 ROW=saminame	ssn	last5	sigi	sex	sbdob	siceidesicerfdt	sicerfpc	sic
erfwh	sicerfge	sicerfpu	sicerfon	sicerfsc	sicerfosicerfoo	sicechrt	sicemhlc	si
cemhhs	sicemhot	sicemhoo	sicecepc	sicecenc	sicecehsicecepr	siceceot	siceceoo	s
iceshqd	siceshpy	siceshnc	siceshot	siceshoo	sipediss

The output could spout out for many pages and several minutes depending on how
many lines of data you have in the .tsv file. Don't worry when you see
******** exception **********, it's not a bad thing.

10. Once the output stops, type "halt" at the prompt to go back out to the 
Unix level.

11. Please then go to the VAPALS application using your web browser. Check with
your system administrator if you haven't been given the web address and your
login credentials. Test to make sure your data was properly entered.




Instructions for reviewing Intake Forms before submitting

1. The IT team and the medical expert team recommends that you review Intake
	Forms the first time you encounter the veteran after moving over to 
	VAPALS-ELCAP instead of trying to do them all at once.

2. Please do a quick review of the data that was entered. If you find an error, 
	please check the spreadsheet to see if it was correct on there. If it was
	correct on the spreadsheet but incorrect on the Intake Form, please let
	your VAPALS-ELCAP IT team know which field was incorrect, and as long as it
	isn't the name or MRN, let us know what the value was on the spreadsheet and 
	on the intake form. If it is, please describe what the difference was as
	specifically as possible.
	
3. Check these fields in particular. If there is not a selection, please fill
	it in. It is most likely to be a "No" but could have been missed
	in the process of entering data in the spreadsheet.
	    a. Eligible based on chart review?
	    b. Was a pre-enrollment discussion held?
	    c. Primary address verified?
	    
4. If everything looks good, hit Submit at the bottom of the form. You can
    choose "Save for Later" if you aren't ready to Submit the form.
	
	
Questions for the Nurse Navigator team.
1. Will all patients in the spreadsheet be enrolled?
2. Do some/all/no patients have pre-enrollment discussions?
3. Do you track addresses? Do you verify addresses?
