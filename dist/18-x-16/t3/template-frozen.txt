#. Description

 #{nmsp} #{version} adds the ability to convert intake data from
 institutions that don't currently use the VAPALS-ELCAP system but
 plan to start. There is also test code as a step towards adding the
 capability to match and merge duplicate patient records.

 The definitive source for the VAPALS-ELCAP application - codebase,
 package distributions(including this one), and documentation - is at
 the following public Github repository:

 https://github.com/VA-PALS-ELCAP/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/

 The most up-to-date and accurate version of this file can be found at

 https://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/#{partialdir}/

 These instructions are for your Vista environment’s sysadmin. As
 usual, please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it
 to your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.

 The changes in this patch are:

 #.#. Added conversion from .tsv file to VAPALS-ELCAP data format

   issue 21-196 (high priority): Support for Nashville test data.

   solution: Developed code to convert data.

   reported: 2021-10-18 by Lilly.

 #.#. Added test for matching report to verify algorithm

   issue 21-115: Capability to merge duplicate patient records.

   solution: This is a partial solution just to test the matching
   algorithm.  Matching and merging records is not yet available.

   reported: 2021-07-09 by Jirapatnakul.

#. Package elements

#>include: .dtool/packelements.txt


#. Prepare for installation

 This involves creating a directory to work in, then going through
 steps to back up M routines that will be replaced by the patch.


 #.#. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user

   This step assumes you use a dzdo or sudo command to do this; here
   the symbol $DEMAND will stand for whichever command you use. (Also,
   in all the command-line examples below, '$' simply means your
   command-line prompt.) If your configuration is different, please
   adjust this step to match your configuration:

    $ $DEMAND su - osehra
    $


 #.#. Prepare install directory

   If this is your first time installling this, execute the following
   commands.  They create a shell variable, and then creates the work
   directory and sets it as your current directory.

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/#{lnmsp}/#{partialdir}
    $ mkdir -p $INDIR
    $ cd $INDIR

   If you've already tried installing this once, you can use the
   following commands instead:

    $ INDIR=~/run/in/#{lnmsp}/#{partialdir}
    $ cd $INDIR
    $ rm -rf ./sami*.{txt,kid}


 #.#. Download and prepare the archive file

   You may safely download the archive file sami-#{version}.zip in advance
   of the actual install.

#>include: .dtool/curl-snippet.txt

   Then unzip the archive file with the following command.

#>include: .dtool/unzip-snippet.txt


 #.#. Back up M routines

   Before the installation, we also need to back up existing
   VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten by this install. To
   do this, you will have to start a Cache or GT.M/YottaDB session
   (depending on your particular installation), sign in to Vista, and
   then call the direct-mode interface ^%RO ("routine out").

   We have made efforts to display accurate instructions, but there
   are likely to be minor differences between implementations. Be sure
   to follow the correct dialog for your implementation.


  #.#.#. Enter M

    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the 'csession' command on Cache or the 'mumps' command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:

    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals

    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS

    > _


    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir

    > _


  #.#.#. Sign into Vista

    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:

    > do ^XUP

    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.

    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100

    Select OPTION NAME:
    > _


  #.#.#. List of routines

    The routine names to save are listed below; you may copy the list
    and paste it at the appropriate Routine prompt. At the final
    Routine prompt, press return to indicate the list of routines is
    done.

#>include: .dtool/routine-list.txt


  #.#.#. Run the backup

    Creating the routine backup file differs by implementation.

    On Caché
    --------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a
    warning message (specifically, the routine name will have '[???]'
    after it, and the line [does not exist] after it). These messages
    can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
    respectively:

#>include: .dtool/cache-ro-snippet.txt

    On YottaDB/GT.M
    ---------------
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the
    routine name not appearing under the input line, and won't count
    towards the number of routines. These can be safely disregarded.

    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Header Label and press return at the Strip comments
    prompt to accept the default of No:

#>include: .dtool/yotta-ro-snippet.txt

   You'll remain in the M environment for the next section.


#. Main install instructions

 This consists of loading and installing the KIDS package, and
 activating the new web-application files.


 #.#. Installing the KIDS package

   This installs the various M assets required by the application.


  #.#.#. Enter the KIDS Installation menu

    At the OPTION NAME prompt, select XPD MAIN to enter the Kernel
    Installation & Distribution System main menu, and at the Select
    ... Option prompt, select Installation:

#>include: .dtool/enter-kids-snippet.txt


  #.#.#. Load KIDS package

    Select option 1 and press return at the Continue prompt.

#>include: .dtool/load-kids-snippet.txt


  #.#.#. Install KIDS package

    Select option 6, enter the space bar at the INSTALL NAME prompt,
    and press return at the next three prompts. Note that '[now]'
    denotes the current time when you're doing the install.

#>include: .dtool/install-kids-snippet.txt

   You now have {appname} {version} ({vista-version})
   installed in your M environment. The install is now complete. We
   recommend running tests of your {appname} app to confirm the
   environment is operational and bug-free, before notifying users
   that {appname} is ready for their use.


#. Optional backout instructions

 Should errors or other problems result from installing this package
 contact the {appname} development team for package-backout
 instructions.


#. Routines

 Lines 2 & 3 of each of these routines now look like:
#>include: .dtool/routine-lines2-3.txt

 The checksums below are Vista Type B checksums (do CHECK1^XTSUMBLD).

#>include: .dtool/checksums.txt
