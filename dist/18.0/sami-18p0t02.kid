This is a hidden field that helps temporarily define the Study ID field 
"^DD",311.101,311.101,.02,21,2,0)
(.01) and thus the primary key for SAMI Intake records. Every I-ELCAP 
"^DD",311.101,311.101,.02,21,3,0)
participant's record will include this field value. It is assigned 
"^DD",311.101,311.101,.02,21,4,0)
automatically by the SAMI application according to the I-ELCAP protocol, 
"^DD",311.101,311.101,.02,21,5,0)
equal to the record number prepended by the letters TM, for example, TM1 
"^DD",311.101,311.101,.02,21,6,0)
or TM42 or TM4321. During the enrollment process, field Study ID (.01) 
"^DD",311.101,311.101,.02,21,7,0)
equals this field, so it is used as the record's primary key value. After
