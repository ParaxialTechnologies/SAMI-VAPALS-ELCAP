1. Description
 
 SAMI 18.13-t1 adds 1 update, correcting an error in translating
 CAC scores from the CT Evaluation form to the CT Evaluation
 report.
 
 The definitive source for the VAPALS-ELCAP application - codebase,
 package distributions (including this one), and documentation - is
 at the following public Github repository:
 
 https://github.com/VA-PALS-ELCAP/SAMI-VAPALS-ELCAP/
 
 These instructions are for your Vista environment’s sysadmin. As
 usual, please capture the complete dialog of your install and send it
 to your VAPALS-ELCAP support team.
 
 The 1 critical bug fixed is:
 
 1.1. Module: CT Report
 
      issues: 21-142, 21-143 The CAC score is sometimes different 
      between the CT Eval form and the report. Circumflex value is 
      always none in report, but CAC score is correct on first view. 
      First view seems to reset the circumflex to none, causing 
      subsequent views to be incorrect.
 
      solution: Found typo of field name in routine and corrected.
      
      reported: 2021-8-11 by Murphy.

3. Backup instructions
 
 It is important when installing packages to back up the existing
 package elements that are about to be changed, so that if anything
 goes wrong with the install, these package elements can be restored.
 For this package, we will back up M routines, form-fields files, and
 www files.
 
 
 3.1. Assume the identity of your osehra Unix user
 
   This step assumes you type a dzdo or sudo to do this; here the
   symbol $DEMAND will stand for whichever command you use. If your
   configuration is different, please adjust this step to match your
   configuration:
 
    $ $DEMAND su - osehra
    $
 
 
 3.2. Prepare install and backup directories
   
   Create install and backup directories
 
  Execute the following commands (`$` simply means your command-line
  prompt). They create a shell variable, and then creates the directory or, 
  if it already exists, removes previous installation files before proceeding.

  $ INDIR=~/run/in/sami/18.13/t1
  $ mkdir -p $INDIR || rm -rf $INDIR/sami-*.{kid,txt} $INDIR/{form-fields,www}
  $ cd $INDIR

   Download and prepare the archive file

 You may safely download the archive file sami-18.13-t1.zip 
 in advance of the actual install. In the following text, [now] represents a 
 time stamp representing your current time, [bits/sec] is a data rate and
 [time]is how long the file took to transfer (both of which vary based on the 
 user's network conditions).
 
    $ wget 'http://vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/sami-18.13-t1.zip'

    $ _
 
 Several files will be overwritten by this install. This step backs those up as
 a safety measure to your working directory.

    Backup files
    
 $ ./step1-backup
 Backing up files ... done.
 $ _


  IMPORTANT NOTE for VA VAPALS-ELCAP sites

 Installations within the VA firewall may not access the VAPALS-ELCAP Git
 repository; they maintain a static copy which is occasionally updated. However,
 this patch and future patches need a way to distinguish between active Git
 repositories and static copies. The easiest way to do this is to remove the
 `.git` directory from the base of the copy; for static copies, it just takes up
 room. However, if you really want to keep it around, the directory can be
 renamed.

 If you are on such a site, please run the following script now, and answer the
 questions appropriately for your installation.

 $ ./step1a-vasites
 This will isolate your static copy of the VAPALS-ELCAP Git repository.
 Are you sure [yes/no/rename] ? y
 Removing .git directory from static copy ... done.
 $ _

 If you decide to rename the directory instead, this is what that would look
 like:

 $ ./step1a-vasites
 This will isolate your static copy of the VAPALS-ELCAP Git repository.
 Are you sure [yes/no/rename] ? r
 Renaming .git directory to .gitstatic ... done.
 $ _

 Note that if this isn't done, the next step may not work properly.

   Install web-application files

 At this point in the install process, the VAPALS-ELCAP routines have been
 updated, but the corresponding web-application files have not; these must first
 be installed. On VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems, the output will look like this:

 $ ./step2-install
 Updating files ... done.
 $ _

 Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date clones of the
 official GitHub repository, and this script will have different output.

 $ ./step2-install
 Found a Git repository; pulling updates.
 remote: Enumerating objects: [...], done.
 remote: Counting objects: 100% ([.../...]), done.
 remote: Compressing objects: 100% ([.../...]), done.
 [... varies ...]
 Done.
 $ _

 
 
 3.3. Enter M
    
    At the unix prompt, enter the M environment in direct mode, using
    the csession command on Cache or the mumps command on
    YottaDB/GT.M:
 
    On Cache:
    ---------
    $ csession vapals
    
    Node: vapalscache, Instance: VAPALS
    
    >
 
 
    On YottaDB/GT.M:
    ----------------
    $ mumps -dir
    
    >
 
 
 3.4. Sign into Vista
    
    At the M prompt, call Vista's direct-mode interface, enter your
    access code, and then just press return at the OPTION NAME prompt
    to return to direct mode. This sets up your authentication
    variables. Here's a sample capture of this step:
 
    > do ^XUP
    
    Setting up programmer environment
    This is a TEST account.
    
    Access Code: *******
    Terminal Type set to: C-VT100
    
    Select OPTION NAME:
    >
 
 
 3.5. Back up routines
    
    Back up existing VAPALS-ELCAP routines that will be overwritten
    by this install. Do this by calling direct-mode interface ^%RO
    (routine out), selecting the list of routines to save, selecting
    sami-18.12.ro to save to, and answering any other additional
    prompts.
    
    The prompts vary between M implementations, so be sure to follow
    the correct dialog for your imp. The routine names to save are
    listed below under each imp; copy the list and paste it at the
    Routine prompt. At the final Routine prompt, press return to
    indicate the list of routines is done.
 
 
    3.5.1. List of routines
SAMICTT3
SAMICTUL

 
 
    3.5.2. On Cache
    
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in a
    warning message (specifically, the routine name will have `[???]`
    after it, and the line [does not exist] after it). These messages
    can be safely disregarded.
    
    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Description and press return at the Parameters and
    Printer Format prompts to accept the defaults of WNS and No,
    respectively:
    
       >do ^%RO

    Routine output (please use %ROMF for object code output)

    >_
 
 
 
    3.5.3. On YottaDB/GT.M
    
    Note that routines that don't currently exist will result in the
    routine name not appearing under the input line, and won't count
    towards the number of routines. These can be safely disregarded.
    
    In addition to naming the routines and routine-out file, we also
    provide a Header Label and press return at the Strip comments
    prompt to accept the default of No:
    
    YottaDB:

    >do ^%RO

   4.4.1. For Non-VA VAPALS-ELCAP systems
   
   Outside the VA firewall, VAPALS-ELCAP systems maintain up-to-date
   clones of the official Github repository. Performing a git pull
   from that repo will automatically update the system's live
   form-fields and www files (the www files are accessed via a symlink
   to the clone's files). Run these commands:
   
    $ cd ~/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/
    $ git pull
    $ cd
    $
 
 
 
 4.5. Activate the form-fields and www files and exit M
 
 The VAPALS-ELCAP routines, form-fields files, and www files have been
 updated at this point, but the routines are using cached copies of
 the files; this step refreshes those copies.
 
 
   4.5.1. Enter M
   
    Repeat step 3.4 to enter M.
   
   
   4.5.2. Sign into Vista
 
    Repeat step 3.5 to sign into Vista.
 
 
   4.5.3. Rebuild M-Web's cached form-fields and www files
   
    To improve performance, M-Web maintains cached copies of the
    form-fields files, which are the data dictionaries for the fields
    on all the VAPALS-ELCAP forms. It also maintains cached copies of
    the HTML templates used by its services. Every time we update
    those data-dictionary or HTML files in Unix, we must also direct
    M-Web to update its cached copies of the data dictionaries and
    clear its cached copies of the HTML files.
    
    Just copy and paste the following list of commands into the
    direct-mode prompt:
    
set SAMIDIR="/home/osehra/lib/silver/a-sami-vapals-elcap--vo-osehra-github/docs/form-fields/"
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"background.tsv","form fields - background")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"biopsy.tsv","form fields - biopsy")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"ct-evaluation.tsv","form fields - ct evaluation")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"follow-up.tsv","form fields - follow up")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"intake.tsv","form fields - intake")
do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"intervention.tsv","form fields - intervention")

do PRSTSV^SAMIFF(SAMIDIR,"register.tsv","form fields - register")
do CLRWEB^SAMIADMN
do INIT2GPH^SAMICTD2
    
    The output is shown below:
