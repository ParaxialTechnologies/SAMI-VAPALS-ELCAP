== Recreating the VA-PALS logo

I couldn't find a VA-PALS vector logo for our purposes.

I couldn't even find a high-resolution image at OSEHRA's site. In the end,
I{nbsp}wound up using an image promoting the VA-PALS Lung Screening Summit
posted by Drew Moghanaki from his Twitter account:

and later, this was pasted into a Skype chat:

Once upon a time, I thought I was going to be a draftsman, back when there was
such a thing. Now they're called ``technical illustrators,'' but this was
before AutoCAD and Illustrator and whatnot.  All my graphic design courses came
later, but here was a situation where my drafting skills were front and center.

=== Color scheme

[options="compact"]
* Dark outer dot and dark segments: H 220° / S 67% / B 66% (++#365baa++).
* Light outer dot and light segments: H 216° / S_63% / B 71% (++#436fb6++).
* Central star: H 7° / S 80% / B 78% (++#c83b28++).



=== Guides

* The first thing I did was scribe a circle around the outer edge of the main
  part of the logo. That turned out to be \units[80,pt] in radius
  (⌀\units[160,pt]). I made that a guide.

* At this point, I reset the ruler origins to that central point.

* Horizontal and vertical guides registered on the center of the logo.

* Circle guides for the central star (outer radius \units[42.5,pt]
  [⌀\units[85,pt]], inner radius{nbsp}\units[17,pt] [⌀\units[34,pt]]), centered
  at origin. (This isn't exact; the star itself appears to be displaced upward,
  but this will be addressed shortly.)

* Circle guides for the ``star gutter,'' or the clear space around the central
  star (outer radius{nbsp}\units[64,pt] [⌀\units[128,pt]], inner radius
  \units[24,pt] [⌀\units[48,pt]]), centered at origin. (This, too, appears to
  be displaced upward; again, this will be addressed shortly.)

* Measured the angle between the center of the logo and the center of the dot
  at the upper right; this annoyingly turned out to be 44°. Then created five
  guides \units[100,pt] long separated at 72° angles (so 44°, 116°, 188°, 260°
  and{nbsp}332°), with the appropriate end of each located at the origin.

* Circle guide for the ``shoulder hunch'' (see below), which is \units[81,pt]
  in radius (⌀\units[162,pt]), and centered at origin.

* Horizontal guide for the top of the horizontal ``arms'' on the star gutter,
  used for positioning later (\units[20,pt] above origin).

* Horizontal guide for the top of the horizontal ``arms'' on the central star,
  used for positioning later (\units[15.5,pt] above origin).

=== Asymmetries

The star (along with its ``gutter'') in the original are displaced upwards by
one point. While this might seem offensive, I understand why it was done: the
human eye would perceive this as ``too low'' because the top of the star
doesn't come across as having as much weight as the bottom. That also means
that the gutters connecting the points of the star to the dots are going to
different. This last part is Really Annoying, but it's only one point at most.

In addition, each segment of the central circle and each outer dot is supposed
to evoke a person reaching out clockwise to another person. You'll note that
the ``left shoulder'' on each of those people is ``hunched up'' by one point to
indicate---well, a shoulder.



. Then I used the Star tool to
create the outer star with the appropriate radii, positioned the top point at
the intersection between the vertical center and the outer radius guide, and
... it turns out it's one point low, so I moved it one point up. Created the
inner star with the same tool, positioned it with the top point in the
appropriate location, and once again moved it one point up.

The next step was to draw the dot at the upper right and figure out where its
center was and what angle it was at compared to the center of the logo. My
initial guess of 45° above the horizontal axis turned out to be off; it's
annoyingly 44°. Since the rest of the circles rest at pentagonal angles, this
made the others at multiples of 72° from that angle: 116°, 188°, 260° and
332°. I drew lines at those angles, positioned the appropriate end of each line
at the center of the logos, and made them into guides. I also determined the
distance of the centers of the dots, and drew another circle of 85pt radius
centered on the logo, and made that a guide as well.



The dot turned out to be 12pt in radius (⌀24pt). I also drew a dot that will ultimately represent the
``gutter,'' which will be eventually cut out of the main circle.  This turns
out to be 15.5pt in radius (⌀31pt). Both the dot and the ``gutter dot'' use the
intersection of the outer circle and the angle lines as their centers, but I
only drew the one pair for now.
