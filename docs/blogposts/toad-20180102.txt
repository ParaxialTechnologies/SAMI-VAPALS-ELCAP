Introducing the VA-PALS Software

VA-PALS Mission Statement: to increase access to safe and effective lung-screening programs that save lives.

To save veterans' lives, the VA-Partnership to increase Access to Lung Screening (VA-PALS) is introducing the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I-ELCAP) medical protocols to the VA health system and adapting them for veterans' healthcare.

Because modern medicine is too complex to conduct without sophisticated support from information technology, using these protocols requires introducing and adapting medical software in four stages.

1. VA-ELCAP: First, the VA-PALS team is installing the current I-ELCAP medical software on a secure, dedicated server within VA's firewall and training and guiding VA personnel to use it. The current software has been developed through seventeen years of empirical investigation, use, and refinement of the medical protocols, which makes it a great fit for VA's culture of evidence-based medicine.

2. Screening Applications Management I-ELCAP (SAMI) v18: While VA-ELCAP is deployed, we are developing a new version that runs natively on VA's existing servers as a new Vista application. Recreating ELCAP within Vista will give both systems direct, secure access to one another's data and processes so they can smoothly integrate.

Compared to VA-ELCAP, SAMI 18 will be adjusted to fit VA's healthcare business practices, based on feedback from VA personnel as they adopt and use the VA-ELCAP and SAMI software to screen and treat veterans. During development, SAMI's design will be regularly updated as recommended by the I-ELCAP research team, as they study and improve their protocols continuously. SAMI will also be adapted to VA security and privacy standards.

3. SAMI v19: While SAMI 18 is installed at the first VA-ELCAP sites in year two, we will develop SAMI 19. VA personnel and the I-ELCAP research team will continue driving SAMI 19's improvement, but the central focus of this version is automation through ELCAP's Vista integration. With access to Vista's Patient file and its Registration, Scheduling, Text Integration Utility, and Clinical Reminders applications, among others, SAMI 19 can weave smoothly into VA's workflows. SAMI 19 forms will prepopulate with Vista patient data so they can be filled out more quickly. SAMI 19 processing will activate Vista activities, such as scheduling and CPRS notifications, that VA personnel expect and rely on in their day-to-day healthcare practices, reducing manual steps.

4. National Rollout: Throughout these three stages, we will be working with VA OIT and VHA to prepare for a national rollout of these life-saving medical protocols and supporting software in year three.

For the next six months or so, our posts and discussions will focus on stage two and its features and architecture.
