Questions:
Did we de-osehra-ify and de-vapals-ify the servers we are sending to Ethiopia?
Adding a New Person requires a nine-digit SSN
Would all new users be cloned from USER,ONE?
How do we designate a Superuser?
How do we give the correct permissions for an Administrator?
What about that letter that appears when a New Person is created?
I don't remember how to add a site but it might be in the .txt of some patch.


Who This Manual Is For
Sometimes actions need to be taken that require either more authority or more
specialized knowledge than the are regularly performed in Screening Plus. This
manual is intended for either the head of the lung-screening program or a
designated medical or technological practitioner working closely with the
person who has the authority to authorize these actions.

This includes actions such as adding or removing users, changing permissions
for certain users, move a patient, produce specialized reports for export, and
maintaining the Screening Plus system.

How To Access Programmer Mode (Administration Dashboard)
Currently some actions require that the administrator access what is called
programmer mode to perform them. A user authorized to take these actions needs
to be entered in the system with special permissions. The first person to have
permission to take these actions needs to be added by your Screening Plus
support team. 

	To Enter Programmer Mode
		Access Screening Plus server 
		I don't quite know how to do this. I believe someone has to set up a
		user in Unix? to allow the person to access the server.
		Type mumps -dir to enter Vista
		Once in that environment,
		  SET DUZ=X, D ^XUP
		Then proceed as the manual instructs.

 As an authorized user of VHA automated information systems (AISs) and 
 having access to data stored in them, I will be given sufficient access to 
 perform my assigned duties.  I will use this access ONLY for its intended 
 purpose and understand the following policies that apply to VA data and 
 computer systems: 
  
 I agree to safeguard all passwords (e.g., Access/Verify codes, electronic 
 signature codes) assigned to me and am strictly prohibited from disclosing
 these codes to anyone including family, friends, fellow workers,
 supervisor(s), and subordinates for ANY reason.  
  
 I understand that I may be held accountable for all entries/changes made to
 any government AIS using my passwords.  
  
 I am aware of the regulations and facility AIS security policies designed 
 to ensure the confidentiality of all sensitive information.  I am aware 
 that information about patients or employees is confidential and protected
 from unauthorized disclosure by law.  I understand that my obligation to
 protect VA information does not end with either the termination of my
 access to this facility's systems or with the termination of my government
 employment.  
  
 I will exercise common sense and good judgment in the use of electronic 
 mail.  I understand that electronic mail is not inherently confidential and
 I have no expectation of privacy in using it.  I understand that technical
 or administrative problems may create situations which requires viewing of
 my messages.  I also understand that facility management officials may
 authorize access to my electronic mail messages whenever there is a
 legitimate purpose for such access.  
  
 I understand that a violation of this notice constitutes disregard of a 
 local and/or VHA policy and will result in appropriate disciplinary action 
 as defined in VA employee conduct Regulations (VAR 820(b)) as well as 
 suspension/termination of access privileges.  
  
 I affirm with my signature that I have read, understand, and agree to 
 fulfill the provisions of this User Access notice.

How To Move A Patient To A Different Site
	Moving A Patient To A Fake Site (Moving Duplicate Patient Records)
	After install, in the vapals programming environment:
DO SITEIDX^SAMIMOV
It won't look like anything happened, but later steps won't be possible
without this step.

In your browser, with the correct information for your site inserted in the
url in place of "vapalsyotta.fiscientific.org", go to
http://vapalsyotta.fiscientific.org:9080/gtree/%25wd(17.040801,%22B%22)

On that page, look for 
|--patient-lookup 
|  |--69 

The number may or may not be 69. Replace the site information
in the following url the same way you did before and if the number is
different replace the 69 with the correct number in the following url.
http://vapalsyotta.fiscientific.org:9080/gtree/%25wd(17.040801,69,%22siteid%22)

If it all worked right, you should see a list of patients separated by
site. You'll notice duplicates because they'll have two or more numbers
under their name.

Choose a Site to move the duplicates to. If you don't have another site
available follow the instructions here: 
http://www.vistaexpertise.net/newsite/project/vapals-elcap/dist/18-x-16/t3/how-to-add-a-vapals-site.html

In the vapals programming environment
> DO DEDUP^SAMIMOV

Here's an example of the interface.

Pick the FROM Site -
Select SAMI SITE: PHI  PHILADELPHIA, PA VAMC     PHI  PA  VAMC  642  
Pick the TO Site -
Select SAMI SITE: SEA  PUGET SOUND HCS     SEA  WA  VAMC  663  
Confirm removing duplicates from  PHI by moving them to SEA? YES

Refresh the last browser page. All of the duplicates should be moved to the
selected site. 

If any step doesn't work, please contact your VAPALS-ELCAP development team.


System Maintenance
	Stopping and Restarting System
	Integrity Checking
Here's one for your notes, if you don't have it already: mupip integ -fast
-REGION '*' which you should run at Unix from time to time to ensure a habitat
is healthy. Eventually, we'll have that automated to run every day, but for
now we're just trying to remember to run it manually whenever we're working
with one of the habitats, as a way to check in and make sure there's no
corruption. That fast integrity check isn't as complete as a full one, but it's
much faster and catches most serious errors.
