**This is the main readme file for all HTML source files**

We can document the librarires used at runtime (bootstrap, jquery, etc.) and also those used at compile time (Jinja). 

Also would be good to note that this readme file gets compiled into a /doc package built by `jsdoc` which documents all our custom developed javascript.

See Jinja documentation for more information about the templating engine
https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/

Take note of some important files like `build.sh`
